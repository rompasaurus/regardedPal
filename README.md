# Dilder

A Tamagotchi-inspired virtual pet built on a Raspberry Pi Pico W with an e-ink display, battery pack, and 3D-printed case — developed entirely in the open as a learning platform, blog series, and YouTube companion project.

The goal isn't just to build a thing — it's to show *how* the thing gets built, from the very first idea to a finished handheld device. Every prompt, every design decision, every dead end is documented so anyone can follow along, learn, and build their own.

## How It Started — Meet Jamal

<p align="center">

  <br />
  <em>Jamal. The plush octopus who started it all.</em>
</p>

This project didn't start with a schematic or a product spec. It started in a TEDi — a German dollar store — where my wife Emma and I found a giant plush octopus grinning up from a discount bin. We bought him on the spot, and on the walk home we started giving him a personality: laid-back, opinionated, a little sassy, suspiciously wise for a boneless creature. By the time we got home, he had a name — **Jamal** — and he'd claimed the armchair like he'd been paying rent.

The question asked itself: *what if we could actually bring him to life?* Not literally — but as a tiny digital companion. A pocket-sized octopus with moods, opinions, and an attitude problem, living on an e-ink screen and judging your life choices in ALL CAPS.

That's how Dilder was born. Not from an engineering roadmap, but from a stuffed animal and two people who couldn't stop anthropomorphizing it on a walk home.

## Enclosure — Rev 2 Mk2

The 3D-printed enclosure is a three-part design: base plate with solar panel recess, AAA battery cradle insert, and top cover with display window and joystick cutout. Designed in OpenSCAD (parametric source) and FreeCAD (visual PartDesign).

### Individual Parts

  <em>All three parts stacked in their mated positions.</em>
</p>

### Full Assembly with Electronics

The FreeCAD macro now imports the official Raspberry Pi Pico 2 STEP file (mechanically identical to the Pico 2 W) and adds procedural 2×20 pin headers. It also builds three more peripherals from datasheet dimensions — two AAA Li-Ion cells in the cradle bays, a TP4056 USB-C charge module in the connecting block indent, and a Waveshare 2.13" e-paper display in the top cover's screen inlay. The Pico is mounted upside-down with its component-side face flush against the cradle's mating plane, headers extending up into the PicoNest cavity.

</p>

See the [FreeCAD macro reference](website/docs/docs/hardware/freecad-mk2-macro.md) for a full walkthrough of how the macro is structured.

### Joystick Thumbpiece

A printable snap cap that fits over the K1-1506SN-01 5-way switch peg. Single disc, 11 mm OD (= cover hole − 1 mm) so it nests inside the cover's joystick cutout with 0.5 mm radial clearance for directional swing. Concave thumb dish on top, rectangular snap socket on the bottom centered on the actuator (the SW1 stick is offset +0.68 mm in Y from the cover hole on the production PCB layout — disc reads visually centered, socket lands on the peg). Built parametrically in `dilder_rev2_mk2.FCMacro` as a separate `Thumbpiece` Body — drop `thumb_sock_x/y` from 3.3 to ~3.15 in the spreadsheet to convert friction-fit to interference snap-fit.

## What This Project Is

- **A virtual pet device** — a pocket-sized, low-power companion with personality, needs, and interactions displayed on an e-ink screen
- **A build series** — a step-by-step guide covering hardware, software, 3D printing, and project planning
- **A transparency experiment** — the entire development process is captured in real time, including AI-assisted prompts, iteration, and mistakes

## Hardware

### Phase 1 — Pico W Prototype (current)

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Board | Raspberry Pi Pico W (or Pico WH with pre-soldered headers) |
| Display | [Waveshare Pico-ePaper-2.13](https://www.waveshare.com/pico-epaper-2.13.htm) — 250x122px, black & white, SPI1, SSD1680 driver, Pico-native 40-pin plug-in module |
| Power | USB micro-B (development); battery TBD |
| Input | 5x 6x6mm tactile push buttons (3 nav + 2 action) via GPIO |

### Future — Pi Zero Upgrade

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Board | Raspberry Pi Zero WH (W or 2 W, pre-soldered headers) |
| Power | LiPo battery + Adafruit PowerBoost 500C |
| Enclosure | 3D-printed case (STL files provided) |

> The Pico W is the starting platform — it's what we have on hand, it's cheap, and it's excellent for prototyping the display and input system. The Pi Zero upgrade comes later when we need Linux, networking features, or more compute.
