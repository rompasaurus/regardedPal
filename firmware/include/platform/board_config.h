/*
 * board_config.h -- Compile-time board selection and pin definitions
 *
 * Provides a unified set of pin/peripheral macros that abstract over the
 * target hardware.  Each board defines the same macro names so the game
 * engine and display driver can use them without #ifdef everywhere.
 *
 * Currently supported boards:
 *   - BOARD_PICO_W       Raspberry Pi Pico W  (RP2040, SPI1)
 *   - BOARD_PICO2_W      Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W  (RP2350, SPI1)
 *   - BOARD_ESP32S3      Olimex ESP32-S3-DevKit-Lipo  (ESP32-S3, FSPI)
 *
 * Set the target board at build time:
 *   cmake  -DTARGET_BOARD=PICO_W ..
 *   cmake  -DTARGET_BOARD=PICO2_W ..
 *   cmake  -DTARGET_BOARD=ESP32S3 ..
 * Or in platformio.ini:
 *   build_flags = -DBOARD_ESP32S3

/*

 *  BEGINNER NOTES: What is this file doing?
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  Different boards have their components wired to different GPIO pins.
 *  For example, the e-Paper display clock wire is connected to:
 *    - GPIO 10 on the Pico W
 *    - GPIO 12 on the ESP32-S3
 *
 *  Instead of scattering these pin numbers throughout the codebase
 *  (which would make switching boards a nightmare), we define them
 *  all HERE using #define macros with consistent names.
 *
 *  The rest of the code just uses PIN_EPD_CLK everywhere.  This file
 *  ensures PIN_EPD_CLK expands to the right number for whichever board
 *  we're building for.
 *
 *  Think of it like a wiring diagram in code form: "On this board,
 *  the clock wire goes to pin 12, the data wire goes to pin 11, ..."
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*

 *  BEGINNER NOTES: #if defined() / #elif / #else preprocessor chains
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  The C preprocessor can make decisions at COMPILE TIME using conditional
 *  directives.  This is different from if/else in regular code, which
 *  makes decisions at RUN TIME.
 *
 *  Preprocessor conditionals actually REMOVE code from the source before
 *  the compiler sees it.  Only the branch that matches gets compiled.
 *  The other branches are thrown away entirely.
 *
 *  Here's the pattern used in this file:
 *
 *    #if defined(BOARD_PICO_W)        // Is BOARD_PICO_W defined?
 *      ... Pico W pin definitions ... // YES: use these
 *
 *    #elif defined(BOARD_PICO2_W)    // Otherwise, is BOARD_PICO2_W defined?
 *      ... Pico 2 W pin definitions  // YES: use these (same pins, more flash)
 *
 *    #elif defined(BOARD_ESP32S3)     // Otherwise, is BOARD_ESP32S3 defined?
 *      ... ESP32-S3 pin definitions . // YES: use these
 *
 *    #else                            // Neither was defined
 *      ... Desktop dummy values ..... // Use these as fallback
 *
 *    #endif                           // End of the conditional chain
 *
 *  "defined(X)" returns true if the symbol X has been #defined, either
 *  in code or via a compiler flag like -DBOARD_ESP32S3.
 *
 *  This is like a switch statement, but it happens before compilation.
 *  Only ONE set of pin definitions ends up in the compiled binary.
 *
 *  You can also use #ifdef X as shorthand for #if defined(X), but
 *  #if defined() is more flexible because you can combine conditions:
 *    #if defined(BOARD_PICO_W) || defined(PICO_BOARD)
 *  This means "if either BOARD_PICO_W or PICO_BOARD is defined."

/*

 *  BEGINNER NOTES: BOARD_NAME, BOARD_FLASH_KB, and other constants
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  Besides pin numbers, each board section defines:
 *
 *  BOARD_NAME — A human-readable string like "Pico W" or "ESP32-S3 (Olimex)".
 *    Used in log messages, status displays, etc.  It doesn't affect
 *    hardware behavior — it's just for humans reading debug output.
 *
 *  BOARD_FLASH_KB — The amount of flash memory (in kilobytes) on the board.
 *    The Pico W has 2 MB (2048 KB), the ESP32-S3 has 8 MB (8192 KB).
 *    This could be used to adjust how much data we store (save files,
 *    game assets, etc.) based on available space.
 *
 *  EPD_SPI_CONTROLLER — Which SPI hardware block to use (see below).
 *
 *  EPD_SPI_FREQ_HZ — The SPI clock speed in Hertz.  4,000,000 = 4 MHz,
 *    meaning 4 million clock pulses per second.  The e-Paper display
 *    datasheet specifies the maximum safe speed.

 *  BEGINNER NOTES: SPI bus selection (SPI0 / SPI1 / FSPI / HSPI)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  Microcontrollers have multiple SPI controllers (hardware blocks that
 *  can each independently run an SPI bus).  You can't just use any of
 *  them — some are reserved:
 *
 *  ESP32-S3 SPI controllers:
 *    SPI0, SPI1 — RESERVED by the chip for accessing the internal flash
 *                 memory.  If you used these, you'd interfere with reading
 *                 your own firmware code.  Never use these for peripherals.
 *    FSPI (SPI3) — "Fast SPI" — the first GENERAL PURPOSE SPI controller.
 *                  This is what we use for the e-Paper display.
 *    HSPI (SPI2) — Another general-purpose SPI controller.  Available if
 *                  you need a second SPI bus for another device.
 *
 *  RP2040 (Pico W) SPI controllers:
 *    SPI0 — General purpose (both are usable on this chip).
 *    SPI1 — General purpose.  We use SPI1 for the display because
 *           the chosen GPIO pins happen to be on SPI1's pin mux.
 *
 *  The EPD_SPI_CONTROLLER macro tells the HAL code which controller
 *  number to use when initializing the SPI bus.
