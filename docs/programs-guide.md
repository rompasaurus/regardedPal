# Dilder Programs Guide

A comprehensive reference for every firmware program in the Dilder project. Each program runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico W with a Waveshare 2.13" e-ink display and renders an animated octopus with mood-specific expressions, body animations, and curated quotes.

## Overview

The `dev-setup/` directory contains **19 programs** total:

- **3 utility programs** for hardware testing and development
- **16 emotional state programs** each featuring a unique octopus personality
- **1 interactive mood selector** that combines all 16 emotional states with keyboard control

All emotional state programs share the same core rendering engine: a runtime pixel renderer that composites body, eyes, mouth, chat bubble, and text onto a 250x122px 1-bit canvas, then pushes it to the e-ink display using partial refresh (~4 second frame cycle).

---

## How Programs Work

### Display Layout

The 250x122 pixel landscape canvas is organized as:

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|              APRIL 12, 2026  3:47 PM             |  <-- Clock header (y=1)

|  @@    @@   |                            |      |
|   @@@@@@ /  +----------------------------+      |
|    |||||       ~ SASSY OCTOPUS ~                 |  <-- Tagline (below bubble)
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

- **Clock header:** Date and time from RTC, centered at y=1
- **Octopus body:** Left side, rendered with RLE-decoded body + mood-specific transforms
- **Eyes:** White sockets with mood-specific pupils (hearts, stars, spirals, etc.)
- **Mouth:** 18 distinct expressions cycled per mood
- **Chat bubble:** Right side, rounded rectangle with speech tail pointing to octopus
- **Quote text:** Word-wrapped 5x7 bitmap font inside the bubble
- **Tagline:** Mood name centered below the bubble

### Animation Cycle

Each mood defines a 4-frame expression cycle. Every ~4 seconds:

1. The current expression is drawn from the cycle (e.g., Smirk -> Open -> Smile -> Open)
2. On every OPEN mouth frame, a new random quote is selected
3. The body transform is applied (shift, wobble, expand based on mood)
4. The frame is rendered to the landscape buffer, transposed to portrait, and pushed via partial refresh

### Quote System

Quotes are stored in `quotes.h` as a static array of `{text, mood_id}` structs. Each program includes only its relevant quotes (except Mood Selector which includes all 823). The DevTool auto-generates `quotes.h` from the Python quote lists in `devtool.py`.

### Building and Flashing

**Via DevTool GUI:**
1. Open DevTool: `python3 DevTool/devtool.py`
2. Select the program from the dropdown
3. Select display variant (V2/V3/V3a/V4)
4. Click "Build & Flash to Pico"
5. Put Pico in BOOTSEL mode (hold BOOTSEL + plug USB)
6. DevTool copies the `.uf2` to the mounted drive

**Via command line:**
```bash
cd dev-setup/
docker compose run --rm build-sassy-octopus bash -c \
  "mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. -DDISPLAY_VARIANT=V3 && make -j4"
# Copy build/sassy_octopus.uf2 to the Pico in BOOTSEL mode
cp sassy-octopus/build/sassy_octopus.uf2 /run/media/$USER/RPI-RP2/
```

## Utility Programs

### Hello World

**Directory:** `dev-setup/hello-world/`

Basic e-ink display test. Draws a simple pattern to verify the display is wired correctly and the SPI bus is working. This is the first program you should flash to confirm hardware is functional.

**Use case:** Hardware verification after initial wiring.

### Hello World Serial

**Directory:** `dev-setup/hello-world-serial/`

Serial-only test program. Prints messages over USB CDC at 115200 baud without driving the display. Useful for verifying the USB serial connection works before flashing display firmware.

**Use case:** Verify USB serial communication before display testing.

### Image Receiver

**Directory:** `dev-setup/img-receiver/`

Receives raw 1-bit bitmap data over USB serial and displays it on the e-ink screen. Used by the DevTool's display emulator to push custom images to the hardware.

**Use case:** Push arbitrary images from DevTool to the physical display.

## Mood Selector (Interactive)

**Directory:** `dev-setup/mood-selector/` | **Quotes:** 823 (all moods combined)

The Mood Selector combines all 16 emotional states into a single interactive firmware. Instead of being locked to one personality, you browse through moods using keyboard input over USB serial.

**On the display:**
- Clock header at top center
- Octopus with the currently selected mood's face, body animation, and a random quote
- Bottom center: `< MOOD_NAME >` with `<` and `>` arrows indicating left/right navigation

**How to use:**
1. Flash `mood_selector.uf2` to the Pico
2. Connect to serial (see [Connecting to the Pico](#connecting-to-the-pico))
3. Press `[` or `]` to cycle through moods
4. Press a letter key for direct mood selection
5. Press `?` to see all available commands

### Serial Input Reference

Connect to the Pico's USB serial port at 115200 baud. All commands are single keystrokes.

#### Mood Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `[` | Previous mood (left) -- wraps around |
| `]` | Next mood (right) -- wraps around |
| `,` | Previous mood (left) -- alternate key |
| `.` | Next mood (right) -- alternate key |
| `r` | Jump to a random mood |

#### Direct Mood Selection

| Key | Mood | Key | Mood |
|-----|------|-----|------|
| `n` | Sassy | `w` | Weird |
| `u` | Unhinged | `a` | Angry |
| `s` | Sad | `c` | Chaotic |
| `h` | Hungry | `t` | Tired |
| `p` | Slap Happy | `l` | Lazy |
| `f` | Fat | `k` | Chill |
| `y` | Horny | `e` | Excited |
| `o` | Nostalgic | `m` | Homesick |

#### Other Commands

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q` | Load a new random quote (same mood) |
| `?` | Print the full help menu to serial |

All keys are case-insensitive (e.g., `A` and `a` both select Angry).

#### Serial Output

When you press a navigation key, the serial monitor shows:

```
----------------------------------------
  KEY ']' pressed  |  >> RIGHT  |  SASSY --> WEIRD
  Now showing: < WEIRD >  (2/16)
----------------------------------------
```

Each animation frame also logs:

```
Frame 5  |  < ANGRY > (4/16)  |  "THE AUDACITY OF THIS ENTIRE OCEAN."
```

### Connecting to the Pico

The Pico communicates over USB CDC serial at 115200 baud. Only one program can hold the port at a time.

**Find the serial port:**
```bash
ls /dev/serial/by-id/
# Look for: usb-Raspberry_Pi_Pico_XXXXX-if00 -> ../../ttyACM0
```

**Connect with screen:**
```bash
screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
# Exit: Ctrl+A then K then Y
```

**Connect with picocom:**
```bash
picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM0
# Exit: Ctrl+A then Ctrl+X
```

**Connect with minicom:**
```bash
minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200
# Exit: Ctrl+A then X
```

**Via DevTool:** The DevTool's Serial Monitor tab connects automatically. Close it before using a terminal, as only one program can hold the port.

> **Note:** If the Pico was just flashed, it will reboot and appear as a serial device within ~1 second. If no device appears at `/dev/ttyACM0`, try unplugging and re-plugging the USB cable (without holding BOOTSEL).
