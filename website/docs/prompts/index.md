# Prompt Log

Every prompt submitted to the AI assistant during Dilder's development, logged with date, token estimates, and files affected.

This is part of the transparency experiment — showing AI-assisted development openly rather than pretending the AI contributions didn't happen.

## Prompt #1 — 2026-04-08

**Prompt:** "Ok, let's create a new git repo for this project and put it up on my rompasaurus GitHub account. Also create a prompt progression file to notate every prompt that I type out for this project in an MD file with date and time stamp and the token count for each and the files created or modified, in an MD file called PromptProgression."

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~75
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~350
- **Files:** `PromptProgression.md` (created), `.git/` (initialized), GitHub repo `rompasaurus/dilder` (created)

## Prompt #2 — 2026-04-08

**Prompt:** "Ok let's set up a README and plan for this project. The idea is to create a learning platform and blog along with a YouTube series that goes through the development process of creating somewhat of a Tamagotchi clone using a Pi Zero, e-ink display, battery, and 3D-printed case. As part of this we are going to document the entire process in this idea creation, starting with the prompts and structure of the project and planning process. Flesh out a README that outlines this intent, marking each addition in phases so that it can be compiled in a proper step-by-step instruction."

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~110
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~2,500
- **Files:** `README.md` (created), `PromptProgression.md` (modified)

---

## Prompt #3 — 2026-04-09

**Prompt:** "Ok let's continue the planning process. Bear in mind each prompt I submit needs to be recorded in PromptProgression.md. I suppose Phase 0 planning is somewhat complete — there is a section to define the pet and personality but I believe that should be planned at a later date. I think the focus first will be piecing together the hardware for a prototype testable unit with a display and input, and perhaps we'll put a placeholder animal animation of sorts to get a scaffold in place code-wise and a process in place for deploying code and testing it. As for the hardware — what we are going to be working with is a Pi Zero and this e-ink display. Let's begin to research the materials list to include this and whatever else hardware-wise will be needed to get a test bench setup for developing on this hardware. Also given this hardware, come up with prototype sketches that could potentially be a 3D-printed casing for these materials and allow for 4–5 buttons of input actions to be recorded on the hardware, and suggest further and research the types of cheap off-the-shelf components that can be used to establish input actions."

Try to mock this up and see if you can generate an actual example prototype full-resolution concept of this, bearing in mind the hardware we are using."

This time let's make the dimensions make sense — the display is going to take up the largest area of the device with the buttons being a quarter or less of the device's face real estate. Let's also take into account the Waveshare's actual dimensions and account for these ratios."

Then we can begin the hardware setup and configure, assuming we bought all the materials listed and assume we bought a Waveshare e-ink display 2.13 the V3 of that display. Compose an in-depth, well-researched setup guide to begin displaying text on the display and compile and run embedded code on the Raspberry Pi. Make the guide as simple and exhaustive as possible.

Let's create a new folder to begin planning this. I would also like to use pwnagotchi.ai as somewhat of an inspiration for how to set this up and organize the website. It doesn't need to be anything ridiculous — in fact, static pages may be the ideal format — along with a Discord group and Patreon page. Let's roll out this folder and christen it with a new MD file."

Make sure while implementing the site to notate every step taken in a website implementation process MD, which will have a nice structured TOC and detailed step-by-step notes on the process of creating this static site — to act as instruction and documentation. I also need a detailed guide on how to add content and update content and the structure of the site, and further steps to deploy on Digital Ocean for as cheap as possible, and the best way to secure a domain for a website. Come up with domain ideas as well. Add steps to create a Patreon and Discord account.

Give a pros and cons list between all the available 3D printing technologies and tech stacks and overhead behind it. Also deep-dive into third-party print options and the pros and cons and price options for this as well. Build a robust document for this with a TOC and pricing estimates.

## Prompt #69 — 2026-04-12

**Prompt:** "Alright we have a sassy octopus, let's make a sassy supportive octopus — same functionality but just the text should be more oriented to humorous but supportive statements, littered with unhinged but weirdly loving statements, sprinkle in some spicy language, and make a huge list of cycled text for this and add it to the programs to be deployable to the Pico."

## Prompt #70 — 2026-04-12

**Prompt:** "OK the sassy quotes are looking sparse compared to the supportive ones, let's expand on this — more unhinged, more weird, more conspiratorial, and more chaotic.

**Prompt:** "Look at the SASSY_QUOTES and SUPPORTIVE_QUOTES blocks of strings.
