# Prompt Log

Every prompt submitted to the AI assistant during Dilder's development, logged with date, token estimates, and files affected.

This is part of the transparency experiment — showing AI-assisted development openly rather than pretending the AI contributions didn't happen.

## Prompt #1 — 2026-04-08

**Prompt:** "Ok, let's create a new git repo for this project and put it up on my rompasaurus GitHub account. Also create a prompt progression file to notate every prompt that I type out for this project in an MD file with date and time stamp and the token count for each and the files created or modified, in an MD file called PromptProgression."

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~75
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~350
- **Files:** `PromptProgression.md` (created), `.git/` (initialized), GitHub repo `rompasaurus/dilder` (created)

## Prompt #2 — 2026-04-08

**Prompt:** "Ok let's set up a README and plan for this project. The idea is to create a learning platform and blog along with a YouTube series that goes through the development process of creating somewhat of a Tamagotchi clone using a Pi Zero, e-ink display, battery, and 3D-printed case. As part of this we are going to document the entire process in this idea creation, starting with the prompts and structure of the project and planning process. Flesh out a README that outlines this intent, marking each addition in phases so that it can be compiled in a proper step-by-step instruction."

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~110
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~2,500
- **Files:** `README.md` (created), `PromptProgression.md` (modified)

---

## Prompt #3 — 2026-04-09

**Prompt:** "Ok let's continue the planning process. Bear in mind each prompt I submit needs to be recorded in PromptProgression.md. I suppose Phase 0 planning is somewhat complete — there is a section to define the pet and personality but I believe that should be planned at a later date. I think the focus first will be piecing together the hardware for a prototype testable unit with a display and input, and perhaps we'll put a placeholder animal animation of sorts to get a scaffold in place code-wise and a process in place for deploying code and testing it. As for the hardware — what we are going to be working with is a Pi Zero and this e-ink display. Let's begin to research the materials list to include this and whatever else hardware-wise will be needed to get a test bench setup for developing on this hardware. Also given this hardware, come up with prototype sketches that could potentially be a 3D-printed casing for these materials and allow for 4–5 buttons of input actions to be recorded on the hardware, and suggest further and research the types of cheap off-the-shelf components that can be used to establish input actions."

Try to mock this up and see if you can generate an actual example prototype full-resolution concept of this, bearing in mind the hardware we are using."

This time let's make the dimensions make sense — the display is going to take up the largest area of the device with the buttons being a quarter or less of the device's face real estate. Let's also take into account the Waveshare's actual dimensions and account for these ratios."

Then we can begin the hardware setup and configure, assuming we bought all the materials listed and assume we bought a Waveshare e-ink display 2.13 the V3 of that display. Compose an in-depth, well-researched setup guide to begin displaying text on the display and compile and run embedded code on the Raspberry Pi. Make the guide as simple and exhaustive as possible.

Let's create a new folder to begin planning this. I would also like to use pwnagotchi.ai as somewhat of an inspiration for how to set this up and organize the website. It doesn't need to be anything ridiculous — in fact, static pages may be the ideal format — along with a Discord group and Patreon page. Let's roll out this folder and christen it with a new MD file."

Make sure while implementing the site to notate every step taken in a website implementation process MD, which will have a nice structured TOC and detailed step-by-step notes on the process of creating this static site — to act as instruction and documentation. I also need a detailed guide on how to add content and update content and the structure of the site, and further steps to deploy on Digital Ocean for as cheap as possible, and the best way to secure a domain for a website. Come up with domain ideas as well. Add steps to create a Patreon and Discord account.

## Prompt #136 — 2026-04-14

**Prompt:** "OK take a look at this project https://github.com/7west/PicoTop/ — this guy designed a purpose-built Pico with the components he wanted to do the things he designed it to do, a simple desktop. But I want to look at this codebase and see how the PicoTop board was designed and implemented. Reverse this process based on the repo and outline this in a research document in the docs folder. Also research what it would take to design a board with all the components I have planned for this project. Outline how they can be designed, what open technologies can be used to create the schematics, and how it can be brought into a physical reality and what services could be used to print out a custom board. Give me a TOC and ample resources that will guide me through this concept to a fleshed-out board and a map of learning and implementation plan to do this."

## Prompt #138 — 2026-04-14

**Prompt:** "Let's add a backstory to the home page and docs. I have this picture of a plush octopus that my wife Emma bought on a day out last week that started the chain of events. We were shopping at the local TEDi and found him in the bin. We anthropomorphized him on the walk home, named him Jamal, and asked: what if we could create a living, responsive, sassy version of this squid? Take this backstory, clean it up, convert the HEIC to JPEG, add it to the site, and flesh out the lore."
