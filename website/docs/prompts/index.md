# Prompt Log

Every prompt submitted to the AI assistant during Dilder's development, logged with date, token estimates, and files affected.

This is part of the transparency experiment — showing AI-assisted development openly rather than pretending the AI contributions didn't happen.

## Prompt #1 — 2026-04-08

**Prompt:** "Ok, let's create a new git repo for this project and put it up on my rompasaurus GitHub account. Also create a prompt progression file to notate every prompt that I type out for this project in an MD file with date and time stamp and the token count for each and the files created or modified, in an MD file called PromptProgression."

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~75
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~350

## Prompt #2 — 2026-04-08

**Prompt:** "Ok let's set up a README and plan for this project. The idea is to create a learning platform and blog along with a YouTube series that goes through the development process of creating somewhat of a Tamagotchi clone using a Pi Zero, e-ink display, battery, and 3D-printed case. As part of this we are going to document the entire process in this idea creation, starting with the prompts and structure of the project and planning process. Flesh out a README that outlines this intent, marking each addition in phases so that it can be compiled in a proper step-by-step instruction."

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~110
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~2,500
- **Files:** `README.md` (created), `PromptProgression.md` (modified)

---

## Prompt #3 — 2026-04-09

**Prompt:** "Ok let's continue the planning process. Bear in mind each prompt I submit needs to be recorded in PromptProgression.md. I suppose Phase 0 planning is somewhat complete — there is a section to define the pet and personality but I believe that should be planned at a later date. I think the focus first will be piecing together the hardware for a prototype testable unit with a display and input, and perhaps we'll put a placeholder animal animation of sorts to get a scaffold in place code-wise and a process in place for deploying code and testing it. As for the hardware — what we are going to be working with is a Pi Zero and this e-ink display. Let's begin to research the materials list to include this and whatever else hardware-wise will be needed to get a test bench setup for developing on this hardware. Also given this hardware, come up with prototype sketches that could potentially be a 3D-printed casing for these materials and allow for 4–5 buttons of input actions to be recorded on the hardware, and suggest further and research the types of cheap off-the-shelf components that can be used to establish input actions."

Try to mock this up and see if you can generate an actual example prototype full-resolution concept of this, bearing in mind the hardware we are using."

Make sure while implementing the site to notate every step taken in a website implementation process MD, which will have a nice structured TOC and detailed step-by-step notes on the process of creating this static site — to act as instruction and documentation. I also need a detailed guide on how to add content and update content and the structure of the site, and further steps to deploy on Digital Ocean for as cheap as possible, and the best way to secure a domain for a website. Come up with domain ideas as well. Add steps to create a Patreon and Discord account.

## Prompts #211–227 — 2026-04-22

**Summary:** Full SCAD enclosure design session for the ESP32-S3 + Waveshare 2.13" display + 1000mAh battery. Started from port identification (pUEXT1 = Olimex UEXT10) and evolved into a 5-piece parametric 3MF-exportable enclosure. The case is a stacked sandwich: rounded base with battery tray at the bottom, middle board tray, display slot, top-mid retainer plate, and open-top cover that wraps over the base.

Iterations hit:

- **Initial sandwich mount** — 3 plates + 4 corner pillars matching board dimensions (56 × 28mm, 22mm between headers, 18 × 6mm antenna).
- **Stacked enclosure** — battery → middle plate → board → display → top-mid plate → cover, with a 5mm gap above the display and a `top_gap` parameter.
- **Shelves + rails** — generalized `plate_shelf()` for both mid/topmid levels; 4 internal corner posts for display lateral constraint; extended lower shelf to the floor (printable rib without overhang).
- **Rounded exterior** — `rounded_v_box` helper, sphere-offset trick for a curvy bottom that still prints upright (~30° overhang). Cover and base top corners match.
- **Flush assembly** — base walls raised to `z_disp_top + plate_thk`, cover reuses the base footprint. Top-mid plate corner notches replaced by shortened rails so the plate top is a solid flush surface.
- **Display snap rails** — two long rails on the top-mid plate underside, each with a 0.5 × 0.5mm bottom lip; rails flex outward when the plate is pressed over the pre-placed display, then snap back with the lips engaging under the display edges.
- **Wire routing** — 30 × 6mm hole through the top-mid plate and snap rail (centered on the -X long edge) for wires; matching 30 × 6 notch at the bottom of the cover's -Y short wall for external pass-through.
- **Screw plugs** — plastic-weldable plug part (`screws.3mf`) that fits the M3 clearance holes; heat-fuse the head to permanently seal the case.

All 5 pieces exported cleanly (CGAL manifold) as 3MF for Bambu Studio: `base.3mf`, `middle.3mf`, `topmid.3mf`, `cover.3mf`, `screws.3mf`. Full SCAD at `hardware-design/esp32s3-enclosure.scad`.

## Prompt #228 — 2026-04-22

**Prompt:** "ok lets take new pics of the latest base revision we made update the docs website and blog add those pics commit then update the prompts commit and push"

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~35
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~9,000
- **Summary:** Published the Rev 2 "extended with joystick" base-v1. Confirmed the staged Tomorrow-colorscheme renders already reflected the final pillar-fillet fix, so no programmatic re-render was needed. Mirrored all 6 renders (top, side, +X end, iso, USB-C closeup, shelf-divet closeup) into `website/docs/assets/images/enclosure/` under a `rev2-base-v1-*` prefix, added a captioned "Rev 2 Extended with Joystick — Base v1" section to the hardware Design Evolution page, and wrote a new blog post [Rev 2 "Extended with Joystick" — a Purpose-Built Base](../blog/rev2-joystick-base/) walking through the asymmetric end walls, dual USB-C cutouts, shelf divets, and the pillar-clipped-to-fillet fix. Committed the base-v1 SCAD/STL/3MF + renders + sketch photos + docs + blog together, then committed and pushed this prompt-log update.

## Prompt #229 — 2026-04-23

**Prompt:** "ok we need to extend the battery and the whol lenght out by 14mm also we need the batter pit to be 3mm deeper and the usb holes to be 1mm lower, also lower the entire height of the base by 10mm"

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~50
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~10,000
- **Summary:** v1.1 resize pass on the Rev 2 joystick base. Five parameter tweaks in `base-v1.scad`: outer X 82→96mm (+14), total Z 22→12mm (-10), battery cell X 52→66mm (+14), ESP32 overhang shelf 2→5mm (battery pit 3mm deeper under the shelf — the interpretation explicitly surfaced before editing, since "deeper" was ambiguous given the shrinking total height), USB-C z-center 7→6mm. Re-rendered all 6 orthographic/ISO views with Tomorrow colorscheme, regenerated STL + 3MF exports (both `Rev 2 .../base-v1.3mf` and `enclosure-prints/base-v1.3mf`), mirrored renders into website assets, updated `design-plan.md` with a v1.1 section (old→new table + derived consequences + open-question about port-center alignment under z=6), and updated both the Design Evolution doc and the blog post with the new numbers/captions. ESP32 chamber headroom dropped to 5mm as a known trade-off.

---

## Prompt #230 — 2026-04-23

**Prompt:** "ok let remove 6.5mm for the length where the battery goes into"

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~15
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~4,000
- **Summary:** v1.2 — the v1.1 battery extension had overshot the real cell. Trimmed 6.5mm end-to-end off the battery section: outer X 96→89.5mm, battery cell X 66→59.5mm. ESP32 chamber inner length is unchanged at 23mm because outer and battery dropped by the same amount. Re-rendered all 6 views, regenerated STL/3MFs, mirrored to website assets, appended a v1.2 section to `design-plan.md`, bumped the numbers and added a v1.2 row + blog subsection in the docs and blog post.

---

## Prompt #231 — 2026-04-23

**Prompt:** "ok lets also move the side holes for the 2 usb c  up 2mm on the side"

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~15
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~3,500
- **Summary:** v1.3 — raised `usb_c_port_vertical_center_z_mm` 6→8mm so the USB cutouts sit fully above the ESP32 shelf (z=7) instead of straddling/slicing through it. Re-rendered the USB-facing views, regenerated STL/3MFs, mirrored assets, added a v1.3 section to `design-plan.md` and matching blog + docs entries.

---

## Prompt #232 — 2026-04-23

**Prompt:** "ok now we nee to poke thorugh 2 small holes in the case so that the boot and reset buuton can be presed eaeling so 17 mm in from the inside edge of the sied with the usb hole and 4.2 mm from the top a 1mm diameter  hole should be place then another hole should be placed 12.5 mm to the left of that hole same distance from the top" (plus follow-up clarifications: move holes to the bottom base because the ESP board is mounted upside-down; Y position 11.5mm in from the outer edge)

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~120
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~12,000
- **Summary:** v1.4 — added two Ø1mm vertical paperclip poke-through holes in the base floor. Went through a few interpretation cycles: first implementation placed them on the +Y long wall, which the user corrected; moved to the bottom base floor with a guessed Y; then settled on the final spec of 11.5mm in from the +Y outer edge (y=32.5mm) so the holes open into the ESP32 chamber where the upside-down-mounted board's BOOT/RESET buttons live. Final X positions: hole 1 at x=71.3 (17mm from +X inner wall), hole 2 at x=58.8 (12.5mm further in). Cylinder axis along Z, subtract spans the full enclosure height so floor + shelf + chamber are all pierced in one op. Added a bottom-view render to the docs + blog, rewrote the v1.4 design-plan section, added v1.4 row to version history, and called out the caveat that hole 2 at x=58.8 lies past the battery/ESP32 divider.

---

## Prompt #233 — 2026-04-23

**Prompt:** "Look at the top-plate-windowed CAD — there's a gap in one side of the rails in the middle. We still need that. Apply it to the top-cover-windowed too. Also the rails seem a bit thicker on the new version — verify the dimensions. I also want more of a curve to the whole front face like the picture. Also the top face is way too thick — I want it as thin as possible and taper down towards the screen edges."

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~100
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~14,000
- **Summary:** Five changes to `top-cover-windowed-v1.scad` in one pass: bullnose radius 2→4 mm, face plate 2→1 mm, rail width pinned to 2.5 mm (was ~4.5 mm), wire pass-through gap added to the -Y rail (30×6 mm), and the display window cut replaced with a `hull()` frustum so the bullnose rolls into the window as a shallow funnel.

---

## Prompt #234 — 2026-04-23

**Prompt:** "Looks pretty good, but the screw-hole pillars are clipping with the top case of the cover and not flush with the round corners. Also the top face plane is really thick — can we halve its width but keep the nice curvature?"

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~40
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~2,500
- **Summary:** Face plate thickness halved 1→0.5 mm. Pillar height capped at `face_plate_top_z_mm` so square pillar corners don't poke past the bullnose.

---

## Prompt #235 — 2026-04-23

**Prompt:** "Perfect. Now we need to get rid of the outside edges of the screw pillar that exist between the rail-connection and the top face — just let it be a passthrough hole in that section, and a square pillar only where it meets the base. Do this for both of those pillars."

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~45
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~3,500
- **Summary:** Shortened -X pillar visibility to `rail_bottom_z` only. Took three iterations — first attempt had no visual effect (shell material was load-bearing, not the pillar union), second attempt added an explicit post-carve subtract, final fix replaced it with a single inlined `difference()` using per-pillar preservation heights to eliminate a coplanar-surface artifact. Facet count dropped 773→703.

---

## Prompt #236 — 2026-04-23

**Prompt:** "Also chamfer the hole for the joystick cutout."

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~10
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~1,500
- **Summary:** Added `joystick_hole_top_taper_width_mm = 1.5` — joystick cut replaced with a `hull()` of two thin cylinders (Ø12 at face plate, Ø15 at cover top), same language as the window taper.

---

## Prompt #237 — 2026-04-23

**Prompt:** "Ok, update the doc and the blog and website and commit. Then update prompts, fix grammar, and commit and push."

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~25
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~8,000
- **Summary:** Documentation rollup for the top-cover windowed session: design-plan.md appended with full top-cover section, design-evolution.md got a new "Rev 2 Top Cover (Windowed) v1" section with 4 renders, new blog post `rev2-top-cover-windowed.md`, and 4 render PNGs mirrored to website assets.

---

## Prompt #238 — 2026-04-24

**Prompt:** "Ok, this print looks pretty good so far — look at the latest shot I took of it. I want to get rid of the 4 holes around the joystick cutout, and then add 0.2 mm thickness to the whole layer of the front face of the cover — just the side where the screen slides into is slightly gaping open, and this should fix that."

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~60
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~4,500
- **Summary:** First-print iteration on the screen-inlay cover: face plate bumped 0.5→0.7 mm (fixes a hairline seam at the inlay top edge), and 4 joystick-PCB mount bores removed (showed as dimples). Applied to both inlay variants (`-v1` and `-v1-2mm`).

---

## Prompt #239 — 2026-04-24

**Prompt:** "Ok, let's look at the window cutout for the display. I attached some screenshots for you to see. The short side closest to the side needs to be extended in by 2 mm, and the top and bottom long sides need to be extended compared to the edge by 1 mm each, to compensate for the actual viewable screen's dimensions."

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~75
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~3,500
- **Summary:** Window resized across all three cover variants: length 50→48 (–X side moves inward 2 mm), depth 25→27 (±Y extend 1 mm each), shift 2→3 (compensates so only –X edge moves). New window bounds X 14.9→62.9, Y 8.5→35.5.

---

## Prompt #240 — 2026-04-24

**Prompt:** "Update docs, blog, and website, commit. Then update prompts, commit again, and push."

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~20
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~9,000
- **Summary:** Documentation rollup for the screen-inlay first-print session: updated `rev2-models-dimensions.md` with before/after window values, new "Rev 2 Top Cover — Screen Inlay Variant" section in design-evolution.md with renders + first-print photos, new blog post `rev2-top-cover-inlay-first-print.md`, and 8 new image assets.

## Prompt #241 — 2026-04-24

**Prompt:** "Give me some FreeCAD files for the topcover-windowed SCAD we just made along with the topcover windowed. I need full blueprints and measurements and a guide to modifying this within FreeCAD."

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~50
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~6,500
- **Summary:** Built `freecad-export/` with STEP + FCStd + CSG for three cover variants, a full `BLUEPRINTS.md` dimensions reference, `FREECAD-GUIDE.md` with three-workflow guide, and orthographic projections. Also built a tuned Bambu filament profile for LANDU PETG (245/240 nozzle, 80/70 bed).
