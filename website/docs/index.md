# Dilder

**A real-time build journal for an open-source AI-assisted virtual pet.**

Dilder is a Tamagotchi-style device built on a Raspberry Pi Pico W, a Waveshare 2.13" e-ink display, and a 3D-printed case — developed entirely in the open, one phase at a time.

---

## What is Dilder?

Dilder is part hardware project, part learning experiment, part documentation exercise.

The goal is to build a functional pocket virtual pet from scratch — and document every decision, mistake, and breakthrough along the way. Hardware selection, enclosure design, firmware, animations, personality systems — all of it is public, with every AI prompt and design iteration logged.

If you've ever wanted to follow a project from "I have an idea" to "here's a working device," this is that.

## Current Phase

!!! info "Phase 2 — Firmware Foundation (C on Pico W)"
    Phase 1 (hardware + tooling) is complete. The octopus now has 16 emotional states with unique faces, body animations, and custom body shapes — all rendered mathematically at runtime in ~100KB of firmware. 17 standalone programs are ready to flash, with 823 total quotes across all personalities. Next up: user input (serial commands and GPIO buttons) and the pet state machine.

## How This Project Works

The entire development process is public:

- **Every prompt** submitted to the AI assistant is logged in the [Prompt Log](prompts/index.md)
- **Every hardware decision** is documented in the [Docs](docs/index.md)
- **Every build step** is written up in the [Blog](blog/index.md)
- **All dev tools** are documented in the [Tools section](docs/tools/devtool.md)
- **All source files** are on [GitHub](https://github.com/rompasaurus/dilder)

This is learn-in-public taken to its logical extreme.
