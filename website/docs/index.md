# Dilder

**A real-time build journal for an open-source AI-assisted virtual pet.**

Dilder is a Tamagotchi-style device built on a Raspberry Pi Pico W, a Waveshare 2.13" e-ink display, and a 3D-printed case — developed entirely in the open, one phase at a time.

## The Origin Story — How Jamal Was Found

<div class="grid" markdown>

<figure markdown="span">

  <figcaption>Jamal. Chair thief. Hat enthusiast. The one who started it all.</figcaption>
</figure>

It started with a trip to TEDi — a German dollar store where the shelves are chaos and the deals are questionable. My wife Emma and I were browsing the bins, not looking for anything in particular, when we spotted him: a massive plush octopus, soft as a cloud, grinning up at us from a pile of discount stuffed animals like he'd been waiting.

We bought him. Obviously.

On the walk home, something happened. We started talking *to* him. Then *about* him — as if he had opinions, preferences, a whole inner life. By the time we got back to the apartment, he had a name: **Jamal**. He had a personality: laid-back but opinionated, a little sassy, suspiciously wise for a creature with no skeleton. He claimed the armchair immediately. He looked... comfortable. *Too* comfortable. Like he'd always lived there and we were the guests.

And then the question asked itself:

> *What if we could actually bring him to life?*

Not literally — we're not mad scientists (yet). But what if we could build a tiny digital version of Jamal? A pocket-sized octopus with moods, opinions, and an attitude problem? Something that lives on a screen, reacts to the world, and roasts you when you forget to feed it?

That's how Dilder was born. Not from a grand engineering vision or a product roadmap — from a plush octopus in a discount bin and two people who couldn't stop giving him a backstory on the walk home.

Jamal still sits in the armchair. He still wears the hat. He watches us build his digital self from across the room, and honestly? He looks unimpressed. Which tracks.

## Meet the Octopus

<div class="grid" markdown>

<figure markdown="span">
  ![Sassy Octopus running on e-ink](assets/images/hardware/sassy-octopus-running.jpg){ width="400" loading=lazy }
  <figcaption>"MATTRESSES ARE BODY SHELVES." — actual device output</figcaption>
</figure>

A tiny octopus lives on a 250x122 pixel e-ink display. It has **16 emotional states**, each with unique eyes, mouth expressions, body animations, and themed quotes. It's sassy. It's opinionated. It runs on 100KB of firmware and a coin cell's worth of ambition.

Pick a personality, flash it to the Pico W, and you've got a desk companion that judges your life choices in ALL CAPS.

## The Hardware

Two components. Eight wires. Under $25.

  <figcaption>First boot — "Hello, Dilder!" on real e-ink</figcaption>
</figure>

</div>

| Component | Price | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Raspberry Pi Pico W | ~$6 | 2MB flash, WiFi + BLE, boots instantly, no OS needed |
| Waveshare 2.13" e-Paper V3 | ~$15 | 250x122px, paper-like readability, near-zero standby current |
| Jumper wires + breadboard | ~$3 | No soldering required for prototyping |

## 16 Emotions, One Octopus

Every mood changes the face, the body, and the attitude.

<div class="grid" markdown>

![Normal](docs/software/emotion-previews/normal.png){ width="220" }
![Angry](docs/software/emotion-previews/angry.png){ width="220" }
![Sad](docs/software/emotion-previews/sad.png){ width="220" }

![Excited](docs/software/emotion-previews/excited.png){ width="220" }
![Lazy](docs/software/emotion-previews/lazy.png){ width="220" }
![Fat](docs/software/emotion-previews/fat.png){ width="220" }

</div>

Normal. Angry. Sad. Excited. Lazy (tentacles draped to the right, naturally). Fat (thicc dome, no waist, proud of it). Plus Weird, Unhinged, Chaotic, Hungry, Tired, Slap Happy, Chill, Horny, Nostalgic, and Homesick.

Each personality has 30-196 themed quotes, a 4-frame mouth animation cycle, and per-mood body movement — breathing bobs, angry trembles, chaotic distortion, lazy lounging.

## The DevTool

A custom Tkinter GUI for designing, previewing, and deploying octopus firmware — without touching a terminal.

<figure markdown="span">
  ![DevTool Programs tab](assets/images/devtool/devtool_tab_programs.png){ width="700" loading=lazy }
  <figcaption>Programs tab — pick a personality, preview it, flash it to the Pico</figcaption>
</figure>

**7 tabs:** Display Emulator (pixel art tools) | Serial Monitor | Flash Firmware | Asset Manager | Programs (17 octopus personalities) | GPIO Pin Reference | Connection Utility

Select a program and you get a live preview, estimated firmware size (~100KB), how much of the Pico's 2MB flash you'll use (~5%), and one-click deploy.

## Current Phase

!!! info "Phase 2 — Firmware Foundation (C on Pico W)"
    Phase 1 (hardware + tooling) is complete. The octopus has 16 emotional states, 17 standalone firmware programs, custom body shapes, and runtime math-based rendering — all in ~100KB. Next up: user input (serial commands and GPIO buttons) and the pet state machine.

    **Done:** Runtime rendering engine | 16 emotions | Body animations | Custom fat/lazy bodies | 823 quotes | C-faithful preview renderer | DevTool with firmware size estimation

    **Next:** Serial command input | GPIO buttons | Game loop with state machine

## How This Project Works

The entire development process is public:

- **Every prompt** submitted to the AI assistant is logged in the [Prompt Log](prompts/index.md) — 104+ and counting
- **Every hardware decision** is documented in the [Docs](docs/index.md)
- **Every build step** is written up in the [Blog](blog/index.md) — 9 posts so far
- **Every drawing function** is verified pixel-by-pixel between C firmware and Python DevTool
- **All source files** are on [GitHub](https://github.com/rompasaurus/dilder)

This is learn-in-public taken to its logical extreme. No hidden steps, no "just trust me" — if it happened, it's documented.

Built with patience, a Pico W, and an unreasonable fondness for a plush octopus named Jamal.
