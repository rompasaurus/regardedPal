# Documentation

Reference documentation for every aspect of the Dilder build. Unlike the [blog](../blog/index.md), docs pages are kept up to date as the project evolves — they reflect current state, not build history.

## The Namesake

Everything in these docs traces back to a single plush octopus named **Jamal** — rescued from a TEDi discount bin, anthropomorphized on a walk home, and now the spiritual mascot of the entire project. The digital octopus on the e-ink display is Jamal's avatar: same attitude, same refusal to take anything seriously, compressed into 250x122 pixels. When the docs reference "the octopus," that's who we're talking about. [Full origin story here.](../index.md#the-origin-story--how-jamal-was-found)
