# Materials List

All components needed to build a Dilder test bench. This list assumes you are building a breadboard prototype — no soldering required at this stage.

---

## Development Platform

**Phase 1 (current):** Raspberry Pi Pico W with MicroPython. Cheap, fast to iterate, instant boot.

**Future (Phase 5):** Raspberry Pi Zero WH with Linux. Upgrade when you need a filesystem, SSH, or more compute.

## Essential Components

Order these first. Everything else can wait.

| Item | Est. Cost | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Raspberry Pi Pico W | ~€6 | RP2040 dual-core, 264KB SRAM, 2MB flash, WiFi + BLE. Micro-USB for power and programming. |
| Waveshare 2.13" e-Paper HAT V3 | ~€15 | SSD1680 driver, 250×122px, black/white. Connected to Pico W via **jumper wires** (not HAT connector). |
| Micro-USB cable | ~€2 | Powers the Pico W and provides serial connection to your dev machine. |
| Half-size breadboard | ~€4 | For wiring buttons and display connections. |
| Jumper wire kit (M-F and M-M) | ~€4 | **Required** — the display HAT cannot plug directly into the Pico W. Use F-M wires from the HAT's 8-pin header to the breadboard. |
| 6×6mm tactile buttons (pack of 20) | ~€3 | Various stem heights. Snap-on colored caps recommended for identifying buttons. |
| **Subtotal** | **~€34** | |

## Useful Extras

Not required to get started, but helpful.

| Item | Est. Cost | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Pico WH (pre-soldered headers) | ~€7 | Easier breadboard use — no header soldering needed. Either Pico W or WH works. |
| 10kΩ resistor assortment | ~€2 | External pull-ups as backup if internal GPIO pull-ups cause issues. |
| Multimeter | ~€12–20 | Debugging wiring continuity and voltage. Useful throughout the build. |
| Soldering iron + solder | ~€20–40 | Not needed for the test bench, but you'll want it for permanent connections later. |

## Battery Power (Phase 6)

Order these when you're ready to move off USB power. See [Hardware Research](https://github.com/rompasaurus/dilder/blob/main/docs/hardware-research.md#battery--power) for the full analysis including battery life estimates and wiring diagrams.

| Item | Est. Cost | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| 3.7V LiPo battery (1000mAh, recommended) | ~€7 | JST PH 2.0mm connector, 50×34×5mm. Wires directly to VSYS — no boost converter needed. Provides ~6.8 days in Tamagotchi mode. |
| 3.7V LiPo battery (2000mAh, max runtime) | ~€10 | 60×40×7mm. ~13.6 days in Tamagotchi mode. Verify enclosure clearance (7mm thick). |
| TP4056 charging module (budget) | ~€1.50 | USB charging with over-discharge protection. Output wires to VSYS pin. |
| Adafruit PowerBoost 500C (upgrade) | ~€16 | LiPo charger + 5V boost + load sharing (use device while charging). Has low-battery output pin. |

!!! tip "No boost converter needed"
    The Pico W's VSYS pin accepts 1.8–5.5V. A 3.7V LiPo sits right in range — just wire LiPo(+) to VSYS and LiPo(-) to GND. Battery voltage monitoring is built in via GPIO29 (ADC3).
