# ESP32 KiCad Reference Designs

A collection of 11 open-source ESP32/ESP32-S3 KiCad projects for reference while designing the Dilder PCB. Each project is in its own folder with full KiCad source files and an ABOUT.md describing its relevance.

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Open in KiCad** — Each folder contains a complete KiCad project. Open the `.kicad_pro` file (or `.sch` for older projects) in KiCad to browse schematics and PCB layouts.

2. **Compare circuits** — Open a reference schematic side-by-side with Dilder's `generate_schematic.py` or the generated `dilder.kicad_sch` to verify wiring.

3. **Copy footprints** — Some projects include custom footprints (especially 01-pocketmage and 07-whirlingbits) that may be useful.

4. **Study layout** — Open `.kicad_pcb` files to see how components are placed and routed on real boards that have been manufactured.

## Disk Space

These are shallow clones (`--depth 1`). To save space, you can delete the `.git` folder in any project you don't plan to update:
```bash
rm -rf 01-pocketmage-pda/.git  # saves ~80% of disk usage per repo
```

## Licenses

Each project has its own license. Check the ABOUT.md in each folder or the LICENSE file in the repo root. Licenses range from CC0 (public domain) to GPL-3.0. None of these restrict you from using them as design references for your own original work.
