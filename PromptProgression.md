# Prompt Progression

A record of every prompt submitted during the development of Dilder.

Spelling and grammar are lightly cleaned for readability while preserving the original intent and voice.

## Fields tracked per entry

Every prompt entry below uses the following fields. Entries that don't yet list all fields should be treated as incomplete and backfilled when the context is recovered.

- **Date/Time** — absolute date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) of the prompt. Relative dates like "Thursday" get resolved when the entry is written.
- **Prompt** — the user's message, quoted. Spelling and grammar are lightly cleaned for readability while preserving the original intent and voice.
- **Input Tokens (est)** — approximate user-facing input token count.
- **Output Tokens (est)** — approximate assistant output token count across the full turn.
- **Commit** — the short SHA + subject line of the git commit that landed the changes from this prompt, in the form `` `abc1234` — commit subject ``. Uses `n/a — <reason>` if no files were changed (research / Q&A / explanation turns) or if the work was never committed.
- **Files Created/Modified** — bulleted list of files touched, with short notes on the change. If nothing changed, omit or write `none`. Multi-prompt sessions may share a single commit; each entry still lists the files the specific prompt touched.

## Prompt #2
- **Date/Time:** 2026-04-08
- **Prompt:** "Let's set up a README and plan for this project. The idea is to create a learning platform and blog along with a YouTube series that goes through the development process of creating a Tamagotchi clone using a Pi Zero, e-ink display, battery, and 3D-printed case. As part of this we are going to document the entire process, starting with the prompts and structure of the project and planning process. Flesh out a README that outlines this intent, marking each addition in phases so that it can be compiled into a proper step-by-step instruction."

## Prompt #3
- **Date/Time:** 2026-04-09
- **Prompt:** "Let's continue the planning process. Bear in mind each prompt I submit needs to be recorded in PromptProgression.md. I suppose Phase 0 planning is somewhat complete — there is a section to define the pet and personality but I believe that should be planned at a later date. I think the focus first will be piecing together the hardware for a prototype testable unit with a display and input, and perhaps we'll put a placeholder animal animation of sorts to get a scaffold in place code-wise and a process in place for deploying code and testing it. As for the hardware, what we are going to be working with is a Pi Zero and this e-ink display. Let's begin to research the materials list to include this and whatever else hardware-wise will be needed to get a test bench setup for developing on this hardware. Also, given this hardware, come up with prototype sketches that could potentially be a 3D-printed casing for these materials and allow for 4–5 buttons of input actions to be recorded on the hardware, and suggest and research the types of cheap off-the-shelf components that can be used to establish input actions."

This time let's make the dimensions make sense — the display is going to take up the largest area of the device with the buttons being a quarter or less of the device's face real estate. Let's also take into account the Waveshare's actual dimensions and account for these ratios."

Let's create a new folder to begin planning this. I would also like to use pwnagotchi.ai as something of an inspiration for how to set this up and organise the website. It doesn't need to be anything ridiculous — in fact, static pages may be the ideal format — along with a Discord group and Patreon page. Let's roll out this folder and christen it with a new MD file."

Make sure while implementing the site to notate every step taken in a website implementation process MD, which will have a nicely structured TOC and detailed step-by-step notes on the process of creating this static site — to act as instruction and documentation. I also need a detailed guide on how to add and update content and the structure of the site, and further steps to deploy on Digital Ocean for as cheap as possible, and the best way to secure a domain for a website. Come up with domain ideas as well. Add steps to create a Patreon and Discord account.

## Prompt #138
- **Date/Time:** 2026-04-14
- **Prompt:** "Let's add a backstory to the home page and docs. I have this picture of a plush octopus that my wife Emma bought on a day out last week that started the chain of events. We were shopping at the local TEDi (dollar store) and found him in the bin all happy, big, and soft. We began to anthropomorphize him on the walk home and slowly a personality was developing. On a whim we came up with the name Jamal. The question ultimately asked itself — when realizing how we gave life to this soft lil octopus, what if we could create a somewhat living, responsive, and sassy version of this squid? What would it take and how could we go about it? Take this backstory, clean it up, expound a little, convert the HEIC picture to JPEG, and add it to the blog home page along with the story. Update the docs and README as well. Add spice and flesh out the lore."

## Prompt #229 — 2026-04-23
- **Prompt:** "ok we need to extend the battery and the whol lenght out by 14mm also we need the batter pit to be 3mm deeper and the usb holes to be 1mm lower, also lower the entire height of the base by 10mm"
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~50
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~10,000
- **Commit:** `575dea2` — Rev 2 joystick base v1.1 → v1.4 + middle-platform v1
- **Files:**
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/base-v1.scad` (modified — 5 parameter tweaks: outer X 82→96, total Z 22→12, battery cell X 52→66, ESP32 overhang shelf 2→5, USB-C z-center 7→6; interpreted "battery pit 3mm deeper" as raising the ESP32 overhang shelf by 3mm so the battery well under the shelf gains 3mm of vertical clearance).
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/base-v1.{stl,3mf}` + `hardware-design/enclosure-prints/base-v1.3mf` (regenerated from the resized SCAD).
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/base-v1-{iso,top,side,end-plusx,usb-closeup,divet}.png` (re-rendered from the final SCAD with Tomorrow colorscheme — closeups use manual camera positions since OpenSCAD CLI `--viewall` centers poorly on partial features).
  - `website/docs/assets/images/enclosure/rev2-base-v1-*.png` (mirror of all 6 renders).
  - `design-plan.md` (appended v1.1 Resize Pass section with old→new value table, derived consequences, and one open question about port-center alignment given the new z=6 cutout).
  - `website/docs/docs/hardware/design-evolution.md` (updated captions + numbers to match v1.1, added 2026-04-23 version-history row).
  - `website/docs/blog/posts/rev2-joystick-base.md` (updated in-place with new dimensions + a "v1.1 resize pass" section documenting the 5 parameter tweaks and the ESP32 chamber headroom trade-off).

## Prompt #232 — 2026-04-23
- **Prompt:** "ok now we nee to poke thorugh 2 small holes in the case so that the boot and reset buuton can be presed eaeling so 17 mm in from the inside edge of the sied with the usb hole and 4.2 mm from the top a 1mm diameter  hole should be place then another hole should be placed 12.5 mm to the left of that hole same distance from the top" (+ multiple clarifications: "you put the holes on the wrong side", "it should be on the bottom base side", "the esp board will be laying upside down in the base and the holes need to be able to go through from there", "the holes need to be 11.5 mm in from the outer edge")
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~120
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~12,000
- **Commit:** `575dea2` — Rev 2 joystick base v1.1 → v1.4 + middle-platform v1
- **Files / iterations during this prompt:**
  - First attempt placed the 2 Ø 1 mm holes on the **+Y long wall** at (x=71.3, z=7.8) and (x=58.8, z=7.8). Clarification revealed the board is mounted component-side down so buttons face the floor, not a side wall.
  - Second attempt moved holes to the **bottom base floor** with Y defaulted to 39.8 (4.2 mm from +Y outer edge). That landed outside the ESP32 chamber Y range → holes would drill through solid plastic.
  - Final: `button_poke_hole_distance_from_plus_y_outer_edge_mm = 11.5` → y=32.5 mm, inside the ESP32 chamber (Y range 7.6–36.4), axis along Z, spanning z=-0.5 to z=12.5 so the floor + shelf + chamber interior are all pierced by a single `difference()`.
  - Final parameters in `base-v1.scad`:
    - `button_poke_hole_diameter_mm = 1.0`
    - `button_poke_hole_1_distance_from_plus_x_inner_wall_mm = 17.0` → x₁ = 71.3 mm
    - `button_poke_hole_2_offset_to_left_of_hole_1_mm = 12.5` → x₂ = 58.8 mm
    - `button_poke_hole_distance_from_plus_y_outer_edge_mm = 11.5` → y = 32.5 mm
  - Mirrored `base-v1.scad` to `hardware-design/scad Parts/base-v1.scad`.
  - Regenerated STL + both 3MFs.
  - Re-rendered `base-v1-{iso,top,side}.png`, added `base-v1-bottom.png` (orthographic view from below showing the 4 pillar screw holes + the 2 small button holes). Discarded an interim side-wall `base-v1-button-holes-closeup.png`.
  - `design-plan.md` v1.4 section rewritten to describe the bottom-floor implementation + final Y value + caveat that hole 2 at x=58.8 is past the battery/ESP32 divider.
  - `website/docs/docs/hardware/design-evolution.md`: added v1.4 hero-paragraph, replaced the "+Y side with button holes" section with a new "Bottom view — BOOT/RESET paperclip poke-through holes" section, added v1.4 row in the version-history table.
  - `website/docs/blog/posts/rev2-joystick-base.md`: appended "v1.4 BOOT / RESET paperclip poke-through holes" section with final coordinates + caveat.
  - Staged alongside this commit (unrelated to the button-hole work but authored in the same branch by the user): `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/middle-platform-v1.scad` and `hardware-design/enclosure-prints/middle-platform-v1.3mf` — a mid-stack platform part for the same Rev 2 assembly.

## Prompt #233 — 2026-04-23
- **Prompt:** "Look at the top-plate-windowed CAD — there's a gap in one side of the rails in the middle. We still need that. Apply it to the top-cover-windowed too. Also the rails seem a bit thicker on the new version — verify the dimensions. I also want more of a curve to the whole front face like the picture. Also the top face is way too thick — I want it as thin as possible and taper down towards the screen edges."
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~100
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~14,000
- **Commit:** `6ce1f8e` — Log Prompts #233-237 — Rev 2 top cover session
- **Files:**
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/top-cover-windowed-v1.scad` (modified — five changes in one pass):
    - `outer_case_top_edge_bullnose_radius_mm` 2 → 4 (bigger rolled top edge).
    - `face_plate_thickness_z_mm` 2 → 1 (thin bezel).
    - New `rail_width_y_mm = 2.5` parameter — rails were filling the whole wall-to-display gap at ~4.5 mm (1.8× Rev 1's ~2.5 mm). Rail Y extents now anchored at inner wall + trim and sized to `rail_width_y_mm`, with the lip cantilevered from rail start across the new wire-routing gap to 1 mm past the display edge.
    - New `wire_pass_through_gap_{length_along_x,depth_along_y}_mm = {30, 6}` parameters + a Stage 3 subtract that notches out the middle of the -Y rail — same pattern as Rev 1, rotated for landscape display orientation.
    - Display window cut replaced with a `hull()` frustum (true size at face-plate bottom → +2 mm per side at cover top) so the bullnose rolls into the window as a shallow funnel.
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/top-cover-windowed-v1.stl` + 4 preview PNGs (`-iso.png`, `-top.png`, `-side.png`, `-under.png`) regenerated from the updated SCAD.

## Prompt #234 — 2026-04-23
- **Prompt:** "Looks pretty good, but the screw-hole pillars are clipping with the top case of the cover and not flush with the round corners. Also the top face plane is really thick — can we halve its width but keep the nice curvature?"
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~40
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~2,500
- **Commit:** `6ce1f8e` — Log Prompts #233-237 — Rev 2 top cover session
- **Files:**
  - `top-cover-windowed-v1.scad` (modified):
    - `face_plate_thickness_z_mm` 1 → **0.5** (halved). Bullnose radius stays at 4 mm so the curve is preserved.
    - Pillar height in the Stage 1 union changed from `cover_total_height_z_mm` → `face_plate_top_z_mm`, so the pillars' square outer corners don't poke past the bullnose. The bullnose above is solid shell material — the M3 bore runs through both.
  - STL + 4 PNGs re-rendered.

---

## Prompt #235 — 2026-04-23
- **Prompt:** "Perfect. Now we need to get rid of the outside edges of the screw pillar that exist between the rail-connection and the top face — just let it be a passthrough hole in that section, and a square pillar only where it meets the base. Do this for both of those pillars."
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~45
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~3,500
- **Commit:** `6ce1f8e` — Log Prompts #233-237 — Rev 2 top cover session
- **Files / iterations:**
  - First attempt: only shortened `pillar_one_round` to `rail_bottom_z_mm` for the -X pillars. This had no effect because `chamber_carve_preserving_pillars` was still preserving the full pillar column out of the shell — the shell material was the load-bearing thing, not the redundant `pillar_one_round` union.
  - User feedback with a highlighted render ("you sliced nothing off") pinpointed the still-visible square pillar above `rail_bottom_z`.
  - Second attempt: added an explicit post-carve subtract block that cut away the shell's pillar column between `rail_bottom_z` and `face_plate_bottom_z` for the -X pillars only. That worked geometrically.
  - User follow-up: "there's a ghost of render still there." That was the coplanar-surface artifact at `z = face_plate_bottom_z_mm` where the post-carve cut shared a boundary with the `chamber_carve_preserving_pillars` top. Final fix replaced the helper call + extra cut with a single inlined `difference()` that uses per-pillar preservation heights (`rail_bottom_z_mm` for -X pillars, `face_plate_bottom_z_mm + 0.1` for +X pillars), eliminating the coincident surface. Facet count dropped 773 → 703 confirming the duplicate boundary was gone.
  - STL + 3 PNGs re-rendered each iteration.

    - New `joystick_hole_top_taper_width_mm = 1.5` parameter.
    - Joystick cut replaced with a `hull()` of two thin cylinders — Ø 12 mm at the face-plate bottom and Ø 15 mm at the top of the cover. Same language as the window taper.

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~25
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~8,000
- **Commit:** `6ce1f8e` — Log Prompts #233-237 — Rev 2 top cover session
- **Files:**
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/design-plan.md` — appended a full "Top cover (windowed)" section: parameter table, Z layout, geometry-pattern notes (tapered window, tapered joystick hole, wire pass-through gap, per-pillar preservation height, pillar cap at bullnose base), known constraints, file list.
  - `website/docs/docs/hardware/design-evolution.md` — new "Rev 2 Top Cover (Windowed) v1" section with iso / top / side / underside renders and commentary; appended 2026-04-23 top-cover row to the version-history table.
  - `website/docs/blog/posts/rev2-top-cover-windowed.md` (new) — sibling blog post to `rev2-joystick-base.md` documenting the same geometry with prose.
  - `website/docs/assets/images/enclosure/rev2-top-cover-windowed-v1-{iso,top,side,under}.png` — 4 renders mirrored from the SCAD folder.

## Prompt #238 — 2026-04-24
- **Prompt:** "Ok, this print looks pretty good so far — look at the latest shot I took of it. I want to get rid of the 4 holes around the joystick cutout, and then add 0.2 mm thickness to the whole layer of the front face of the cover — just the side where the screen slides into is slightly gaping open, and this should fix that."

- **Output Tokens (est):** ~4,500
- **Commit:** `2560376` — Log Prompts #238-240 — Rev 2 screen-inlay first-print iteration
- **Context:** Between prompt #237 (the prior session's doc/blog rollup) and this one, the user committed `eaa4593` — a big refactor of the Rev 2 cover family, authored outside this session. That commit introduced two new files, `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1.scad` (3 mm FPC divet) and `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1-2mm.scad` (2 mm divet sibling), each adding a Waveshare-sized inlay recess, a 20×20 mm joystick-PCB pocket with 4 blind corner mount bores, and an FPC-ribbon divet cut into the -X wall. The existing `top-cover-windowed-v1.scad` was also rewritten in that same commit — rails + lips removed, all four corner pillars full-height, M3 bores made blind from below, and a new `display_window_shift_toward_joystick_x_mm = 2` param added for asymmetric bezel. Two new print photos (`rev2-print-1.jpg`, `rev2-print-2.jpg`) were also staged — the user's first print of the inlay variant, which this prompt reacts to.
- **Files:**
  - `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1-2mm.scad` (modified):
    - `face_plate_thickness_z_mm` 0.5 → **0.7** (comment added explaining the first-print seam along the inlay's top edge where 0.5 mm printed as one perimeter + one thin top layer and didn't fully close).
    - 4 joystick-PCB mount bores removed from the Stage 3 subtract block — replaced with a comment block noting the retention strategy (glue / press-fit / heat-set inserts) hasn't been decided yet. The `joystick_pcb_mount_bore_*` parameter definitions are kept so the geometry is one block away from returning.
  - `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1.scad` (modified identically — mirrored the same two edits to the 3 mm-divet sibling for parity).
  - STLs re-exported for both inlay variants. Preview PNG confirmed the ring of dimples around the joystick cutout was gone — only the joystick through-hole + 4 corner M3 bores remain on the underside.

---

## Prompt #239 — 2026-04-24
- **Prompt:** "Ok, let's look at the window cutout for the display. I attached some screenshots for you to see. The short side closest to the side needs to be extended in by 2 mm, and the top and bottom long sides need to be extended compared to the edge by 1 mm each, to compensate for the actual viewable screen's dimensions."
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~75
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~3,500
- **Commit:** `2560376` — Log Prompts #238-240 — Rev 2 screen-inlay first-print iteration
- **Files / interpretation:**
  - Four `waveshare-screen-*.jpg` photos (staged in the same folder) showed the raw Waveshare 2.13" module from the front (`-1`), from the back (`-2`), seated in the printed inlay with the cover inverted (`-3`), and from the side (`-4`). Against those, the 50 × 25 window on the first print read as 2 mm too long in X on the -X end (cut past the viewable pixels into dead bezel) and 2 mm too short in Y overall (cut *into* the viewable pixels at the ±Y edges).
  - Applied to all three cover variants for consistency:
    - `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1-2mm.scad`
    - `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1.scad`
    - `top-cover-windowed-v1.scad`
  - Parameter deltas (all three files):
    - `display_viewing_window_length_along_x_mm`: 50 → **48** (-X short side moves inward 2 mm)
    - `display_viewing_window_depth_along_y_mm`: 25 → **27** (±Y long sides each extend 1 mm outward)
    - `display_window_shift_toward_joystick_x_mm`: 2 → **3** (compensates for the length reduction so only the -X edge moves — +X edge stays at X=62.9)
  - New window bounds: X 14.9 → 62.9, Y 8.5 → 35.5. -X bezel grows 9.5 → 11.5 mm, ±Y bezels shrink 2.5 → 1.5 mm each, +X bezel and joystick-hole position unchanged.
  - All three STLs re-exported.

## Prompt #240 — 2026-04-24
- **Prompt:** "Update docs, blog, and website, commit. Then update prompts, commit again, and push."
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~20
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~9,000
- **Commit:** `2560376` — Log Prompts #238-240 — Rev 2 screen-inlay first-print iteration
- **Files:**
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/rev2-models-dimensions.md` — three sections updated:
    - §3.4 Display viewing window: added a "Updated 2026-04-24" note and a side-by-side table showing first-print vs. post-update values; recomputed the X/Y ranges at face-plate bottom and at cover top; new bezel summary (-X 11.5, +X 5.5, ±Y 1.5 each).
    - §4.1 Inlay Z-stack overrides: added face_plate_thickness row (0.5 → 0.7) with the first-print seam explanation; recomputed face_plate_top_z_mm (12.5 → 12.7) and cover_total_height_z_mm (16.5 → 16.7); added a paragraph noting the window updates in §3.4 apply to the inlay variants too.
    - §4.4 Joystick PCB mount bores: retitled "REMOVED 2026-04-24", kept the coordinate table as a reference in case the retention plan brings them back; noted the SCAD parameters are still in the file.
    - §6 Caveats: added a bullet noting the face-plate thickness now diverges across variants (base v1 still at 0.5 mm, both inlay variants at 0.7 mm).
  - `website/docs/docs/hardware/design-evolution.md`:
    - New "Rev 2 Top Cover — Screen Inlay Variant (2026-04-24)" section between the windowed-v1 top-cover section and "Current Assembly". Covers the iso/top/under/side renders, the Waveshare module + inlay fit-check photos, the three first-print fixes, and the final window resize with a before/after table.
    - Version history appended three rows: one for the windowed-v1 → v1.1 pivot (rails gone, blind bores, +X window shift), one for the new screen-inlay family, and one for the first-print iteration (face plate bump, removed bores, window resize).
  - `website/docs/blog/posts/rev2-top-cover-inlay-first-print.md` (new) — blog post walking through the three first-print fixes with photos and tables. Sibling to `rev2-top-cover-windowed.md` from the prior session.
  - `website/docs/assets/images/enclosure/` — 8 new assets: 4 inlay SCAD renders (`rev2-top-cover-inlay-v1-{iso,top,under,side}.png`), 2 first-print photos (`rev2-top-cover-inlay-print-{1,2}.jpg`), and 2 Waveshare module photos (`waveshare-2-13-front.jpg`, `waveshare-2-13-in-inlay.jpg`).
  - 4 preview PNGs rendered alongside the SCAD (in the Rev 2 folder) as well.
  - Committed as `a3b9660` — `Rev 2 screen-inlay top cover — first-print fixes + docs`.
  - `PromptProgression.md` (this file) — prompts #238–#240 appended, grammar lightly cleaned per the file's header convention.

## Prompt #241 — 2026-04-24
- **Prompt:** "Give me some FreeCAD files for the topcover-windowed SCAD we just made along with the topcover windowed. I need full blueprints and measurements and a guide to modifying this within FreeCAD."
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~50
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~6,500
- **Commit:** (this session)
- **Files / interpretation:**
  - Built `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/freecad-export/` containing three formats per cover variant via a `freecadcmd` Python script that loads the SCAD-exported STL, builds a `Part::Feature` from the mesh, and writes both `.FCStd` and `.step`:
    - `*.step` (parametric STEP solid)
    - `*.FCStd` (native FreeCAD with both `Mesh::Feature` and derived `Part::Feature`)
    - `*.csg` (OpenSCAD CSG dump for FreeCAD's OpenSCAD workbench)
  - Variants exported: `top-cover-windowed-v1`, `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1`, `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1-2mm`.
  - `BLUEPRINTS.md` — full dimensions reference: outer shell, walls, Z-stack, corner pillars, screw pattern, display window (tapered), joystick hole (tapered), screen inlay recess, FPC ribbon divet (3 mm and 2 mm variants), joystick PCB pocket, mount bores, exact bezel margins.
  - `FREECAD-GUIDE.md` — three-workflow guide (FCStd / STEP / CSG), worked Boolean examples (resize joystick hole, add a tab, fillet bottom edges), measurement-verification procedure, regeneration script reference, and gotchas (rounded surfaces appear as 48-segment facets because the STEP is reconstructed from the OpenSCAD mesh at `$fn = 48`).
  - `blueprints/` subfolder — 5 orthographic projections per variant.
- **Bambu filament-settings sub-thread (same prompt batch):** built a tuned profile for LANDU PETG (1.75 mm, marketed as 30–600 mm/s): 245 / 240 nozzle, 80 / 70 bed, 40 % max fan, 1.0 mm retract, gyroid 20 % infill, 4 walls. Recommended `Generic PETG` as the closest preset (not `Bambu PETG HF` — runs 260 °C, too hot for LANDU). Print orientation: face-plate-down, no supports needed.

## Prompt #242 — 2026-04-24/25
- **Prompt sequence:** "Design a AAA battery cradle insert to mesh with the top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v3-2piece — align the 2 AAA batteries close to the base where the joystick holes are and fill in the rest of the gaps around the Pico board and inside walls with a thick plane." Followed by 12+ refinement turns: "what the fuck is this — I just need a cutout of the negative space," "move the battery holes 3 mm past the pillar cutouts," "move the batteries apart so they meet the long sides," "cut off the top portion at the widest diameter," "reduce the middle block by 10 mm," "add the middle inset to the other side," several "wrong direction" iterations on the connecting block's position, "extend it to meet the pillar hole edges," and finally "OK lets build a base plate to complement the insert — it should have a cutout that matches the cradle and pegs for the screw holes to snap into."
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~1,200 across the sequence
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~22,000
- **Commit:** (this session)
- **Files / interpretation:**
  - `04-24-designs-alterations/aaa-cradle-insert-v1.scad` (new, then iterated 13× over the session). Final geometry:
    - Outer 86.7 × 41.4 × 12.1 plug shaped to the negative space of `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v3-2piece`'s interior.
    - 2× AAA bays laying along X (cells flush with ±Y long edges; centers at Y=7.85 / Y=38.15).
    - +X end of bay pulled back 3 mm past the +X corner pillar cutout's -X edge so the bays don't run into the pillar footprint.
    - Top half of each bay's bounding box cut away above the cell equator — cells drop in from above.
    - Pico nest (X=6.3 → 48.1) — through-cut in the middle Y stripe for the Pico to nest against the back of the Waveshare.
    - FPC ribbon gap (X=3.3 → 6.3, full Y, full Z).
    - Connecting block (X=3.3 → 12.8, Y=12.1 → 33.9, Z=-2.1 → 7) — solid material added AFTER the Pico-nest cut, fills the -X end of the nest with structural mass while leaving a 3 mm cable pass-through underneath.
    - The big iteration cost was the connecting block's position — went +X end → -X end → -Y edge → +Y edge → middle of Pico nest → flush with -X inset → flush with +X plug edge → finally settled on flush with the -X inset's +X edge after the user described it as "flush with the short side closest to the origin."
  - `04-24-designs-alterations/base-plate-v1.scad` (new) — shallow 91.5 × 46 × 7 tray that closes the bottom of the cradle+cover stack:
    - Curved-bottom fillet matching base-v3-2piece's outer profile.
    - Pocket 5.3 mm deep at cradle XY (slop 0.2 / edge) — receives the cradle's bottom 5.1 mm.
    - 4 pegs at the cover's screw-bore centers — ⌀ 3.0 mm slip fit in the 3.2 mm cover M3 bores, 9.3 mm long total, rise from the **pocket floor** (Z=1.7) so they're integral columns instead of floating rods above the pocket. Chamfered 0.4 mm tip self-guides each peg into the cover bore.
    - Brief detour where solid mesas filled X = 0–25 and X = 76.5–91.5 of the pocket (so the cradle's ±X ends would land on solid material instead of the open pocket); user reverted, kept the pocket fully open along X.
- **Stack-up summary:** base plate (Z=0–7) + cradle (Z=1.9–14) + cover (Z=7–18.7). Total enclosure height **18.7 mm**. Peg-snap retention replaces M3 bolts for the bottom-to-cover joint.

## Prompt #243 — 2026-04-25
- **Prompt:** "Update the docs and website and commit, then update prompts, then take a copy of every SCAD and put it in a new folder and rename them with the date and time created — describe the board and what electronics are expected to fit with it and what the board ties with — overall something super descriptive so I can have an organized list in a historical folder."
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~80
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~5,500
- **Commit:** (this session)
- **Files / interpretation:**
  - `website/docs/blog/posts/rev2-aaa-cradle-and-base-plate.md` (new) — blog post for this session covering the rationale for splitting the cradle from the base, full geometry tables for both new parts, the global-Z stack-up diagram, print orientation notes, and an "open questions" list (cell contacts, snap retention strength, cradle ↔ display alignment).
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/historical-archive/` (new folder) — chronological snapshot of every SCAD in the Rev 2 family. 15 files, each renamed `<YYYY-MM-DD>_<HHMM>_<original-name>__<short-descriptor>.scad`. The 3-piece-original family snapshots as `2026-04-24_2110_*` (live parent-folder versions), the dual-10440 / 2-piece family as `2026-04-24_2124_*` (alteration-fork versions), the AAA cradle as `2026-04-24_2333_*`, and the base plate as `2026-04-25_0035_*`.
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/historical-archive/INDEX.md` (new) — long-form descriptor for every archived file: what it is, footprint, electronics that fit (1000 mAh flat Li-Po vs 2× 10440 vs 2× AAA; ESP32-S3 dev board vs Pico W vs Pico 2; Waveshare 2.13" raw module vs HAT; custom joystick PCB), what it mates with in the stack, and what distinguishes it from sibling files. Includes "How to use this archive" section explaining the append-only policy and the recovery procedure.
  - `PromptProgression.md` (this file) — prompts #241–#243 appended.
