# Prompt Progression

A record of every prompt submitted during the development of Dilder.

Spelling and grammar are lightly cleaned for readability while preserving the original intent and voice.

## Fields tracked per entry

Every prompt entry below uses the following fields. Entries that don't yet list all fields should be treated as incomplete and backfilled when the context is recovered.

- **Date/Time** — absolute date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) of the prompt. Relative dates like "Thursday" get resolved when the entry is written.
- **Prompt** — the user's message, quoted. Spelling and grammar are lightly cleaned for readability while preserving the original intent and voice.
- **Input Tokens (est)** — approximate user-facing input token count.
- **Output Tokens (est)** — approximate assistant output token count across the full turn.
- **Commit** — the short SHA + subject line of the git commit that landed the changes from this prompt, in the form `` `abc1234` — commit subject ``. Uses `n/a — <reason>` if no files were changed (research / Q&A / explanation turns) or if the work was never committed.
- **Files Created/Modified** — bulleted list of files touched, with short notes on the change. If nothing changed, omit or write `none`. Multi-prompt sessions may share a single commit; each entry still lists the files the specific prompt touched.

## Prompt #2
- **Date/Time:** 2026-04-08
- **Prompt:** "Let's set up a README and plan for this project. The idea is to create a learning platform and blog along with a YouTube series that goes through the development process of creating a Tamagotchi clone using a Pi Zero, e-ink display, battery, and 3D-printed case. As part of this we are going to document the entire process, starting with the prompts and structure of the project and planning process. Flesh out a README that outlines this intent, marking each addition in phases so that it can be compiled into a proper step-by-step instruction."

## Prompt #3
- **Date/Time:** 2026-04-09
- **Prompt:** "Let's continue the planning process. Bear in mind each prompt I submit needs to be recorded in PromptProgression.md. I suppose Phase 0 planning is somewhat complete — there is a section to define the pet and personality but I believe that should be planned at a later date. I think the focus first will be piecing together the hardware for a prototype testable unit with a display and input, and perhaps we'll put a placeholder animal animation of sorts to get a scaffold in place code-wise and a process in place for deploying code and testing it. As for the hardware, what we are going to be working with is a Pi Zero and this e-ink display. Let's begin to research the materials list to include this and whatever else hardware-wise will be needed to get a test bench setup for developing on this hardware. Also, given this hardware, come up with prototype sketches that could potentially be a 3D-printed casing for these materials and allow for 4–5 buttons of input actions to be recorded on the hardware, and suggest and research the types of cheap off-the-shelf components that can be used to establish input actions."

This time let's make the dimensions make sense — the display is going to take up the largest area of the device with the buttons being a quarter or less of the device's face real estate. Let's also take into account the Waveshare's actual dimensions and account for these ratios."

Let's create a new folder to begin planning this. I would also like to use pwnagotchi.ai as something of an inspiration for how to set this up and organise the website. It doesn't need to be anything ridiculous — in fact, static pages may be the ideal format — along with a Discord group and Patreon page. Let's roll out this folder and christen it with a new MD file."

Make sure while implementing the site to notate every step taken in a website implementation process MD, which will have a nicely structured TOC and detailed step-by-step notes on the process of creating this static site — to act as instruction and documentation. I also need a detailed guide on how to add and update content and the structure of the site, and further steps to deploy on Digital Ocean for as cheap as possible, and the best way to secure a domain for a website. Come up with domain ideas as well. Add steps to create a Patreon and Discord account.

## Prompt #138
- **Date/Time:** 2026-04-14
- **Prompt:** "Let's add a backstory to the home page and docs. I have this picture of a plush octopus that my wife Emma bought on a day out last week that started the chain of events. We were shopping at the local TEDi (dollar store) and found him in the bin all happy, big, and soft. We began to anthropomorphize him on the walk home and slowly a personality was developing. On a whim we came up with the name Jamal. The question ultimately asked itself — when realizing how we gave life to this soft lil octopus, what if we could create a somewhat living, responsive, and sassy version of this squid? What would it take and how could we go about it? Take this backstory, clean it up, expound a little, convert the HEIC picture to JPEG, and add it to the blog home page along with the story. Update the docs and README as well. Add spice and flesh out the lore."

  - `website/docs/docs/hardware/design-evolution.md` (modified — new "Rev 2 Extended with Joystick — Base v1" section with all 6 renders captioned, plus a new version-history row).
  - `website/docs/blog/posts/rev2-joystick-base.md` (created — design-story blog post covering layout split, asymmetric end walls, dual USB-C cutouts, shelf divets, and the pillar-clipped-to-fillet fix).
  - Committed the base-v1 SCAD/STL/3MF/renders/sketch photos + docs + blog together as `3f313be` ("Add Rev 2 joystick base v1 — SCAD, renders, docs page, blog post"), then committed this prompt-log update separately before pushing.

## Prompt #229 — 2026-04-23
- **Prompt:** "ok we need to extend the battery and the whol lenght out by 14mm also we need the batter pit to be 3mm deeper and the usb holes to be 1mm lower, also lower the entire height of the base by 10mm"
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~50
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~10,000
- **Commit:** `575dea2` — Rev 2 joystick base v1.1 → v1.4 + middle-platform v1
- **Files:**
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/base-v1.scad` (modified — 5 parameter tweaks: outer X 82→96, total Z 22→12, battery cell X 52→66, ESP32 overhang shelf 2→5, USB-C z-center 7→6; interpreted "battery pit 3mm deeper" as raising the ESP32 overhang shelf by 3mm so the battery well under the shelf gains 3mm of vertical clearance).
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/base-v1.{stl,3mf}` + `hardware-design/enclosure-prints/base-v1.3mf` (regenerated from the resized SCAD).
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/base-v1-{iso,top,side,end-plusx,usb-closeup,divet}.png` (re-rendered from the final SCAD with Tomorrow colorscheme — closeups use manual camera positions since OpenSCAD CLI `--viewall` centers poorly on partial features).
  - `website/docs/assets/images/enclosure/rev2-base-v1-*.png` (mirror of all 6 renders).
  - `design-plan.md` (appended v1.1 Resize Pass section with old→new value table, derived consequences, and one open question about port-center alignment given the new z=6 cutout).
  - `website/docs/docs/hardware/design-evolution.md` (updated captions + numbers to match v1.1, added 2026-04-23 version-history row).
  - `website/docs/blog/posts/rev2-joystick-base.md` (updated in-place with new dimensions + a "v1.1 resize pass" section documenting the 5 parameter tweaks and the ESP32 chamber headroom trade-off).

## Prompt #232 — 2026-04-23
- **Prompt:** "ok now we nee to poke thorugh 2 small holes in the case so that the boot and reset buuton can be presed eaeling so 17 mm in from the inside edge of the sied with the usb hole and 4.2 mm from the top a 1mm diameter  hole should be place then another hole should be placed 12.5 mm to the left of that hole same distance from the top" (+ multiple clarifications: "you put the holes on the wrong side", "it should be on the bottom base side", "the esp board will be laying upside down in the base and the holes need to be able to go through from there", "the holes need to be 11.5 mm in from the outer edge")
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~120
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~12,000
- **Commit:** `575dea2` — Rev 2 joystick base v1.1 → v1.4 + middle-platform v1
- **Files / iterations during this prompt:**
  - First attempt placed the 2 Ø 1 mm holes on the **+Y long wall** at (x=71.3, z=7.8) and (x=58.8, z=7.8). Clarification revealed the board is mounted component-side down so buttons face the floor, not a side wall.
  - Second attempt moved holes to the **bottom base floor** with Y defaulted to 39.8 (4.2 mm from +Y outer edge). That landed outside the ESP32 chamber Y range → holes would drill through solid plastic.
  - Final: `button_poke_hole_distance_from_plus_y_outer_edge_mm = 11.5` → y=32.5 mm, inside the ESP32 chamber (Y range 7.6–36.4), axis along Z, spanning z=-0.5 to z=12.5 so the floor + shelf + chamber interior are all pierced by a single `difference()`.
  - Final parameters in `base-v1.scad`:
    - `button_poke_hole_diameter_mm = 1.0`
    - `button_poke_hole_1_distance_from_plus_x_inner_wall_mm = 17.0` → x₁ = 71.3 mm
    - `button_poke_hole_2_offset_to_left_of_hole_1_mm = 12.5` → x₂ = 58.8 mm
    - `button_poke_hole_distance_from_plus_y_outer_edge_mm = 11.5` → y = 32.5 mm
  - Mirrored `base-v1.scad` to `hardware-design/scad Parts/base-v1.scad`.
  - Regenerated STL + both 3MFs.
  - Re-rendered `base-v1-{iso,top,side}.png`, added `base-v1-bottom.png` (orthographic view from below showing the 4 pillar screw holes + the 2 small button holes). Discarded an interim side-wall `base-v1-button-holes-closeup.png`.
  - `design-plan.md` v1.4 section rewritten to describe the bottom-floor implementation + final Y value + caveat that hole 2 at x=58.8 is past the battery/ESP32 divider.
  - `website/docs/docs/hardware/design-evolution.md`: added v1.4 hero-paragraph, replaced the "+Y side with button holes" section with a new "Bottom view — BOOT/RESET paperclip poke-through holes" section, added v1.4 row in the version-history table.
  - `website/docs/blog/posts/rev2-joystick-base.md`: appended "v1.4 BOOT / RESET paperclip poke-through holes" section with final coordinates + caveat.
  - Staged alongside this commit (unrelated to the button-hole work but authored in the same branch by the user): `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/middle-platform-v1.scad` and `hardware-design/enclosure-prints/middle-platform-v1.3mf` — a mid-stack platform part for the same Rev 2 assembly.

## Prompt #233 — 2026-04-23
- **Prompt:** "Look at the top-plate-windowed CAD — there's a gap in one side of the rails in the middle. We still need that. Apply it to the top-cover-windowed too. Also the rails seem a bit thicker on the new version — verify the dimensions. I also want more of a curve to the whole front face like the picture. Also the top face is way too thick — I want it as thin as possible and taper down towards the screen edges."
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~100
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~14,000
- **Commit:** `6ce1f8e` — Log Prompts #233-237 — Rev 2 top cover session
- **Files:**
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/top-cover-windowed-v1.scad` (modified — five changes in one pass):
    - `outer_case_top_edge_bullnose_radius_mm` 2 → 4 (bigger rolled top edge).
    - `face_plate_thickness_z_mm` 2 → 1 (thin bezel).
    - New `rail_width_y_mm = 2.5` parameter — rails were filling the whole wall-to-display gap at ~4.5 mm (1.8× Rev 1's ~2.5 mm). Rail Y extents now anchored at inner wall + trim and sized to `rail_width_y_mm`, with the lip cantilevered from rail start across the new wire-routing gap to 1 mm past the display edge.
    - New `wire_pass_through_gap_{length_along_x,depth_along_y}_mm = {30, 6}` parameters + a Stage 3 subtract that notches out the middle of the -Y rail — same pattern as Rev 1, rotated for landscape display orientation.
    - Display window cut replaced with a `hull()` frustum (true size at face-plate bottom → +2 mm per side at cover top) so the bullnose rolls into the window as a shallow funnel.
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/top-cover-windowed-v1.stl` + 4 preview PNGs (`-iso.png`, `-top.png`, `-side.png`, `-under.png`) regenerated from the updated SCAD.

## Prompt #234 — 2026-04-23
- **Prompt:** "Looks pretty good, but the screw-hole pillars are clipping with the top case of the cover and not flush with the round corners. Also the top face plane is really thick — can we halve its width but keep the nice curvature?"
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~40
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~2,500
- **Commit:** `6ce1f8e` — Log Prompts #233-237 — Rev 2 top cover session
- **Files:**
  - `top-cover-windowed-v1.scad` (modified):
    - `face_plate_thickness_z_mm` 1 → **0.5** (halved). Bullnose radius stays at 4 mm so the curve is preserved.
    - Pillar height in the Stage 1 union changed from `cover_total_height_z_mm` → `face_plate_top_z_mm`, so the pillars' square outer corners don't poke past the bullnose. The bullnose above is solid shell material — the M3 bore runs through both.
  - STL + 4 PNGs re-rendered.

---

## Prompt #235 — 2026-04-23
- **Prompt:** "Perfect. Now we need to get rid of the outside edges of the screw pillar that exist between the rail-connection and the top face — just let it be a passthrough hole in that section, and a square pillar only where it meets the base. Do this for both of those pillars."
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~45
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~3,500
- **Commit:** `6ce1f8e` — Log Prompts #233-237 — Rev 2 top cover session
- **Files / iterations:**
  - First attempt: only shortened `pillar_one_round` to `rail_bottom_z_mm` for the -X pillars. This had no effect because `chamber_carve_preserving_pillars` was still preserving the full pillar column out of the shell — the shell material was the load-bearing thing, not the redundant `pillar_one_round` union.
  - User feedback with a highlighted render ("you sliced nothing off") pinpointed the still-visible square pillar above `rail_bottom_z`.
  - Second attempt: added an explicit post-carve subtract block that cut away the shell's pillar column between `rail_bottom_z` and `face_plate_bottom_z` for the -X pillars only. That worked geometrically.
  - User follow-up: "there's a ghost of render still there." That was the coplanar-surface artifact at `z = face_plate_bottom_z_mm` where the post-carve cut shared a boundary with the `chamber_carve_preserving_pillars` top. Final fix replaced the helper call + extra cut with a single inlined `difference()` that uses per-pillar preservation heights (`rail_bottom_z_mm` for -X pillars, `face_plate_bottom_z_mm + 0.1` for +X pillars), eliminating the coincident surface. Facet count dropped 773 → 703 confirming the duplicate boundary was gone.
  - STL + 3 PNGs re-rendered each iteration.

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~25
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~8,000
- **Commit:** `6ce1f8e` — Log Prompts #233-237 — Rev 2 top cover session
- **Files:**
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/design-plan.md` — appended a full "Top cover (windowed)" section: parameter table, Z layout, geometry-pattern notes (tapered window, tapered joystick hole, wire pass-through gap, per-pillar preservation height, pillar cap at bullnose base), known constraints, file list.
  - `website/docs/docs/hardware/design-evolution.md` — new "Rev 2 Top Cover (Windowed) v1" section with iso / top / side / underside renders and commentary; appended 2026-04-23 top-cover row to the version-history table.
  - `website/docs/blog/posts/rev2-top-cover-windowed.md` (new) — sibling blog post to `rev2-joystick-base.md` documenting the same geometry with prose.
  - `website/docs/assets/images/enclosure/rev2-top-cover-windowed-v1-{iso,top,side,under}.png` — 4 renders mirrored from the SCAD folder.

## Prompt #238 — 2026-04-24
- **Prompt:** "Ok, this print looks pretty good so far — look at the latest shot I took of it. I want to get rid of the 4 holes around the joystick cutout, and then add 0.2 mm thickness to the whole layer of the front face of the cover — just the side where the screen slides into is slightly gaping open, and this should fix that."

- **Output Tokens (est):** ~4,500
- **Commit:** `2560376` — Log Prompts #238-240 — Rev 2 screen-inlay first-print iteration
- **Context:** Between prompt #237 (the prior session's doc/blog rollup) and this one, the user committed `eaa4593` — a big refactor of the Rev 2 cover family, authored outside this session. That commit introduced two new files, `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1.scad` (3 mm FPC divet) and `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1-2mm.scad` (2 mm divet sibling), each adding a Waveshare-sized inlay recess, a 20×20 mm joystick-PCB pocket with 4 blind corner mount bores, and an FPC-ribbon divet cut into the -X wall. The existing `top-cover-windowed-v1.scad` was also rewritten in that same commit — rails + lips removed, all four corner pillars full-height, M3 bores made blind from below, and a new `display_window_shift_toward_joystick_x_mm = 2` param added for asymmetric bezel. Two new print photos (`rev2-print-1.jpg`, `rev2-print-2.jpg`) were also staged — the user's first print of the inlay variant, which this prompt reacts to.
- **Files:**
  - `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1-2mm.scad` (modified):
    - `face_plate_thickness_z_mm` 0.5 → **0.7** (comment added explaining the first-print seam along the inlay's top edge where 0.5 mm printed as one perimeter + one thin top layer and didn't fully close).
    - 4 joystick-PCB mount bores removed from the Stage 3 subtract block — replaced with a comment block noting the retention strategy (glue / press-fit / heat-set inserts) hasn't been decided yet. The `joystick_pcb_mount_bore_*` parameter definitions are kept so the geometry is one block away from returning.
  - `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1.scad` (modified identically — mirrored the same two edits to the 3 mm-divet sibling for parity).
  - STLs re-exported for both inlay variants. Preview PNG confirmed the ring of dimples around the joystick cutout was gone — only the joystick through-hole + 4 corner M3 bores remain on the underside.

---

## Prompt #239 — 2026-04-24
- **Prompt:** "Ok, let's look at the window cutout for the display. I attached some screenshots for you to see. The short side closest to the side needs to be extended in by 2 mm, and the top and bottom long sides need to be extended compared to the edge by 1 mm each, to compensate for the actual viewable screen's dimensions."
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~75
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~3,500
- **Commit:** `2560376` — Log Prompts #238-240 — Rev 2 screen-inlay first-print iteration
- **Files / interpretation:**
  - Four `waveshare-screen-*.jpg` photos (staged in the same folder) showed the raw Waveshare 2.13" module from the front (`-1`), from the back (`-2`), seated in the printed inlay with the cover inverted (`-3`), and from the side (`-4`). Against those, the 50 × 25 window on the first print read as 2 mm too long in X on the -X end (cut past the viewable pixels into dead bezel) and 2 mm too short in Y overall (cut *into* the viewable pixels at the ±Y edges).
  - Applied to all three cover variants for consistency:
    - `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1-2mm.scad`
    - `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1.scad`
    - `top-cover-windowed-v1.scad`
  - Parameter deltas (all three files):
    - `display_viewing_window_length_along_x_mm`: 50 → **48** (-X short side moves inward 2 mm)
    - `display_viewing_window_depth_along_y_mm`: 25 → **27** (±Y long sides each extend 1 mm outward)
    - `display_window_shift_toward_joystick_x_mm`: 2 → **3** (compensates for the length reduction so only the -X edge moves — +X edge stays at X=62.9)
  - New window bounds: X 14.9 → 62.9, Y 8.5 → 35.5. -X bezel grows 9.5 → 11.5 mm, ±Y bezels shrink 2.5 → 1.5 mm each, +X bezel and joystick-hole position unchanged.
  - All three STLs re-exported.

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~20
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~9,000
- **Commit:** `2560376` — Log Prompts #238-240 — Rev 2 screen-inlay first-print iteration
- **Files:**
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/rev2-models-dimensions.md` — three sections updated:
    - §3.4 Display viewing window: added a "Updated 2026-04-24" note and a side-by-side table showing first-print vs. post-update values; recomputed the X/Y ranges at face-plate bottom and at cover top; new bezel summary (-X 11.5, +X 5.5, ±Y 1.5 each).
    - §4.1 Inlay Z-stack overrides: added face_plate_thickness row (0.5 → 0.7) with the first-print seam explanation; recomputed face_plate_top_z_mm (12.5 → 12.7) and cover_total_height_z_mm (16.5 → 16.7); added a paragraph noting the window updates in §3.4 apply to the inlay variants too.
    - §4.4 Joystick PCB mount bores: retitled "REMOVED 2026-04-24", kept the coordinate table as a reference in case the retention plan brings them back; noted the SCAD parameters are still in the file.
    - §6 Caveats: added a bullet noting the face-plate thickness now diverges across variants (base v1 still at 0.5 mm, both inlay variants at 0.7 mm).
  - `website/docs/docs/hardware/design-evolution.md`:
    - New "Rev 2 Top Cover — Screen Inlay Variant (2026-04-24)" section between the windowed-v1 top-cover section and "Current Assembly". Covers the iso/top/under/side renders, the Waveshare module + inlay fit-check photos, the three first-print fixes, and the final window resize with a before/after table.
    - Version history appended three rows: one for the windowed-v1 → v1.1 pivot (rails gone, blind bores, +X window shift), one for the new screen-inlay family, and one for the first-print iteration (face plate bump, removed bores, window resize).
  - `website/docs/blog/posts/rev2-top-cover-inlay-first-print.md` (new) — blog post walking through the three first-print fixes with photos and tables. Sibling to `rev2-top-cover-windowed.md` from the prior session.
  - `website/docs/assets/images/enclosure/` — 8 new assets: 4 inlay SCAD renders (`rev2-top-cover-inlay-v1-{iso,top,under,side}.png`), 2 first-print photos (`rev2-top-cover-inlay-print-{1,2}.jpg`), and 2 Waveshare module photos (`waveshare-2-13-front.jpg`, `waveshare-2-13-in-inlay.jpg`).
  - 4 preview PNGs rendered alongside the SCAD (in the Rev 2 folder) as well.
  - Committed as `a3b9660` — `Rev 2 screen-inlay top cover — first-print fixes + docs`.
  - `PromptProgression.md` (this file) — prompts #238–#240 appended, grammar lightly cleaned per the file's header convention.

## Prompt #241 — 2026-04-24
- **Prompt:** "Give me some FreeCAD files for the topcover-windowed SCAD we just made along with the topcover windowed. I need full blueprints and measurements and a guide to modifying this within FreeCAD."
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~50
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~6,500
- **Commit:** (this session)
- **Files / interpretation:**
  - Built `hardware-design/scad Parts/Rev 2 extended with joystick/freecad-export/` containing three formats per cover variant via a `freecadcmd` Python script that loads the SCAD-exported STL, builds a `Part::Feature` from the mesh, and writes both `.FCStd` and `.step`:
    - `*.step` (parametric STEP solid)
    - `*.FCStd` (native FreeCAD with both `Mesh::Feature` and derived `Part::Feature`)
    - `*.csg` (OpenSCAD CSG dump for FreeCAD's OpenSCAD workbench)
  - Variants exported: `top-cover-windowed-v1`, `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1`, `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v1-2mm`.
  - `BLUEPRINTS.md` — full dimensions reference: outer shell, walls, Z-stack, corner pillars, screw pattern, display window (tapered), joystick hole (tapered), screen inlay recess, FPC ribbon divet (3 mm and 2 mm variants), joystick PCB pocket, mount bores, exact bezel margins.
  - `FREECAD-GUIDE.md` — three-workflow guide (FCStd / STEP / CSG), worked Boolean examples (resize joystick hole, add a tab, fillet bottom edges), measurement-verification procedure, regeneration script reference, and gotchas (rounded surfaces appear as 48-segment facets because the STEP is reconstructed from the OpenSCAD mesh at `$fn = 48`).
  - `blueprints/` subfolder — 5 orthographic projections per variant.
- **Bambu filament-settings sub-thread (same prompt batch):** built a tuned profile for LANDU PETG (1.75 mm, marketed as 30–600 mm/s): 245 / 240 nozzle, 80 / 70 bed, 40 % max fan, 1.0 mm retract, gyroid 20 % infill, 4 walls. Recommended `Generic PETG` as the closest preset (not `Bambu PETG HF` — runs 260 °C, too hot for LANDU). Print orientation: face-plate-down, no supports needed.

## Prompt #242 — 2026-04-24/25
- **Prompt sequence:** "Design a AAA battery cradle insert to mesh with the top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v3-2piece — align the 2 AAA batteries close to the base where the joystick holes are and fill in the rest of the gaps around the Pico board and inside walls with a thick plane." Followed by 12+ refinement turns: "what the fuck is this — I just need a cutout of the negative space," "move the battery holes 3 mm past the pillar cutouts," "move the batteries apart so they meet the long sides," "cut off the top portion at the widest diameter," "reduce the middle block by 10 mm," "add the middle inset to the other side," several "wrong direction" iterations on the connecting block's position, "extend it to meet the pillar hole edges," and finally "OK lets build a base plate to complement the insert — it should have a cutout that matches the cradle and pegs for the screw holes to snap into."
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~1,200 across the sequence
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~22,000
- **Commit:** (this session)
- **Files / interpretation:**
  - `04-24-designs-alterations/aaa-cradle-insert-v1.scad` (new, then iterated 13× over the session). Final geometry:
    - Outer 86.7 × 41.4 × 12.1 plug shaped to the negative space of `top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v3-2piece`'s interior.
    - 2× AAA bays lying along X (cells flush with ±Y long edges; centers at Y=7.85 / Y=38.15).
    - +X end of bay pulled back 3 mm past the +X corner pillar cutout's -X edge so the bays don't run into the pillar footprint.
    - Top half of each bay's bounding box cut away above the cell equator — cells drop in from above.
    - Pico nest (X=6.3 → 48.1) — through-cut in the middle Y stripe for the Pico to nest against the back of the Waveshare.
    - FPC ribbon gap (X=3.3 → 6.3, full Y, full Z).
    - Connecting block (X=3.3 → 12.8, Y=12.1 → 33.9, Z=-2.1 → 7) — solid material added AFTER the Pico-nest cut, fills the -X end of the nest with structural mass while leaving a 3 mm cable pass-through underneath.
    - The big iteration cost was the connecting block's position — went +X end → -X end → -Y edge → +Y edge → middle of Pico nest → flush with -X inset → flush with +X plug edge → finally settled on flush with the -X inset's +X edge after the user described it as "flush with the short side closest to the origin."
  - `04-24-designs-alterations/base-plate-v1.scad` (new) — shallow 91.5 × 46 × 7 tray that closes the bottom of the cradle+cover stack:
    - Curved-bottom fillet matching base-v3-2piece's outer profile.
    - Pocket 5.3 mm deep at cradle XY (slop 0.2 / edge) — receives the cradle's bottom 5.1 mm.
    - 4 pegs at the cover's screw-bore centers — ⌀ 3.0 mm slip fit in the 3.2 mm cover M3 bores, 9.3 mm long total, rise from the **pocket floor** (Z=1.7) so they're integral columns instead of floating rods above the pocket. Chamfered 0.4 mm tip self-guides each peg into the cover bore.
    - Brief detour where solid mesas filled X = 0–25 and X = 76.5–91.5 of the pocket (so the cradle's ±X ends would land on solid material instead of the open pocket); user reverted, kept the pocket fully open along X.
- **Stack-up summary:** base plate (Z=0–7) + cradle (Z=1.9–14) + cover (Z=7–18.7). Total enclosure height **18.7 mm**. Peg-snap retention replaces M3 bolts for the bottom-to-cover joint.

## Prompt #243 — 2026-04-25
- **Prompt:** "Update the docs and website and commit, then update prompts, then take a copy of every SCAD and put it in a new folder and rename them with the date and time created — describe the board and what electronics are expected to fit with it and what the board ties with — overall something super descriptive so I can have an organized list in a historical folder."
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~80
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~5,500
- **Commit:** (this session)
- **Files / interpretation:**
  - `website/docs/blog/posts/rev2-aaa-cradle-and-base-plate.md` (new) — blog post for this session covering the rationale for splitting the cradle from the base, full geometry tables for both new parts, the global-Z stack-up diagram, print orientation notes, and an "open questions" list (cell contacts, snap retention strength, cradle ↔ display alignment).
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/historical-archive/` (new folder) — chronological snapshot of every SCAD in the Rev 2 family. 15 files, each renamed `<YYYY-MM-DD>_<HHMM>_<original-name>__<short-descriptor>.scad`. The 3-piece-original family snapshots as `2026-04-24_2110_*` (live parent-folder versions), the dual-10440 / 2-piece family as `2026-04-24_2124_*` (alteration-fork versions), the AAA cradle as `2026-04-24_2333_*`, and the base plate as `2026-04-25_0035_*`.
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/historical-archive/INDEX.md` (new) — long-form descriptor for every archived file: what it is, footprint, electronics that fit (1000 mAh flat Li-Po vs 2× 10440 vs 2× AAA; ESP32-S3 dev board vs Pico W vs Pico 2; Waveshare 2.13" raw module vs HAT; custom joystick PCB), what it mates with in the stack, and what distinguishes it from sibling files. Includes "How to use this archive" section explaining the append-only policy and the recovery procedure.
  - `PromptProgression.md` (this file) — prompts #241–#243 appended.

- **Output Tokens (est):** ~5,000
- **Commit:** `9d2c4ce` — `Historical archive: README with TOC, filename procedure, and per-part renders` + a follow-up commit for the prompt log update.
- **Files / interpretation:**
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/historical-archive/renders/` (new) — 15 iso preview PNGs (one per archived SCAD), rendered from the same camera so the parts read as a consistent visual catalogue. Each render's filename mirrors its SCAD's filename minus the `.scad` extension.
  - `hardware-design/scad Parts/historical-archive/README.md` (new) — front-of-folder document with:
    - Table of contents — flat list of every part grouped by date heading
    - "Filename procedure" section — formal definition of the `<YYYY-MM-DD>_<HHMM>_<original>__<descriptor>.scad` naming spec, with a token-by-token table explaining where each component comes from and why the double-underscore separator exists (single split-token between machine identity and human descriptor)
    - "How to use this archive" cheatsheet — `diff` between snapshots, recovering a file (drop the date+descriptor parts), adding a new snapshot, verifying every file still renders
    - Per-part sections (15 of them) — each with a linked iso render, what it is, footprint, electronics it houses, what it mates with in the stack, and distinguishing features. The descriptions match the existing `INDEX.md` but reformatted with images and consistent headings.
  - `PromptProgression.md` (this file) — prompt #244 appended in a separate follow-up commit.

## Prompt #246 — 2026-04-25
- **Prompt sequence:** "ok I have added a new pic this is the next design change we need to make I have the usb charge board placed where I ideally want it to be but what we have to do is extend the left side of the model by 3 mm then in the insert on the left side where it juts into meet the pico we need it to extend up and down to curve around the battery to allow then a 1 mm indent for the usb board to nestle into then we also need to modify the base plate so that it has square pillars with the pegs coming out 3 mm from them and a curved side extruding on the long sides where it will curve to fit the battery essentially it's going to lay flush and tightly hold in the battery and the right side of the board once closed" — followed by 6 refinement turns fixing battery bay wall clipping, flipping battery cradle trough orientation on the base plate (3 iterations: floating above → inverted arch → carved into plate body), adding the +X display connector cutout, and flipping the cutout to the bottom face.

- **Commit:** `e3c3485` — `Rev 2 TP4056 integration — cradle v2, base plate v2, cover USB-C cutout`
- **Files / interpretation:**
  - `04-25-design-alterations/aaa-cradle-insert-v1.scad` (modified — 8 changes):
    - `enclosure_outer_width_along_x_axis_mm`: 91.5 → 94.5 (+3 mm on -X side)
    - Connecting block: `length_along_x_mm` 9.5 → 29 (accommodate 28 mm TP4056), `height_reduction_from_plug_mm` 3.0 → 0 (full plug height z=-5.1 to 7.0)
    - `-X inset` updated to match: length 29, height reduction 0
    - Concave battery-following curves on ±Y faces of the connecting block (horizontal cylinder subtractions at AAA bay centers, ~1.3 mm deep arcs)
    - 1 mm TP4056 indent on connecting block top face (28.4 × 17.4 mm recess centered in Y)
    - USB-C port cutout through the connecting block's -X face (10 × 5 mm slot at y=23, z=5.5)
    - AAA bay cuts restructured: moved from inner `difference()` to an outer `difference()` wrapping the entire `union()` of plug + connecting block — eliminates residual walls at the block/bay junction. Bay X range extended from `plug_x_start_mm` (full length) instead of `connecting_block_x_end_mm`
    - +X display connector cutout: 3 mm pocket from the **bottom face** at the +X end (z=-5.1 to -2.1), Pico nest Y width, for FPC connector/cable clearance
  - `04-25-design-alterations/base-plate-v1.scad` (modified — 4 changes):
    - `enclosure_outer_width_along_x_axis_mm`: 91.5 → 94.5

    - Bare cylindrical pegs replaced with square 5×5 mm pillar bases (pocket floor to plate top) topped by 3 mm cylindrical pegs with chamfered tips
    - Battery cradle troughs along ±Y sides: solid fills inside the pocket connected to the enclosure walls (from pocket floor z=1.7 to plate top z=7.0) with AAA cylinder subtracted downward — concave channels the cells drop into. Three iterations to get orientation right (initially floating above plate, then inverted arch, finally carved into plate body)
  - `04-25-design-alterations/top-cover-windowed-screen-inlay-v3-2piece.scad` (modified — 3 changes):
    - `enclosure_outer_width_along_x_axis_mm`: 91.5 → 94.5
    - Joystick through-hole center hardcoded at x=79.35 (was computed formula that would shift +1.5 mm due to enclosure extension)
    - USB-C port cutout through the -X wall (10 × 5 mm at y=23, z=5.5 cover-local)
  - 5 render PNGs: `rev2-cradle-insert-v2-{iso,top}.png`, `rev2-base-plate-v2-{iso,top}.png`, `rev2-top-cover-v3-2piece-usbc-iso.png`

## Prompt #250 — 2026-04-26
- **Prompt sequence:** Joystick PCB iteration sequence (~10 turns):
  (1) "ok lets work on the joystick pcb you started earlier I can open the schematic and the board is empty when i use kicad Expecting '(' in '...joystick-pcb.kicad_pcb', line 86, offset 3. lets fix this" —
  (2) "the schematic wont open either" —
  (3) "ok lets fix the design of this you halucinated a bunch and the wiring is completely unfeasable look online to see if similar pcb design are availble to copy and make sure no holes overlap" —
  (4) "also autoroute the wiring 2 layer pcb and all that jaz no 90 degre turns in the wiring" —
  (5) "autoroute the wire and confirm the schematic wiring steal an existing one rather than making it up".
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~250 across the sequence
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~38,000
- **Commit:** `6d3bbe2`
- **Summary:** Joystick breakout PCB Rev 2.0 — three-stage repair of the Rev 1 board.
  Stage 1 (parser fixes): stripped illegal `;;` comments from `joystick-pcb.kicad_pcb` (KiCad's S-expression parser doesn't accept comments), replaced KiCad-rejected `net_label` keyword with `label`, regenerated 35 bogus quoted UUIDs as proper UUID4 format, added missing `(sheet_instances)` block.
  Stage 2 (footprint redesign): cloned the `SKRHA-boss` footprint verbatim from `crides/kleeb` (production-tested keyboard library), rotated -45° so pads land axis-aligned on left/right body faces. All clearances Python-verified before placement (0.74 mm min pad↔M3, 1.0 mm pad↔pad, 2.30 mm to board edge). Wire pads moved to bottom edge at 1.8 mm pitch — Rev 1's GND pad was overlapping a mounting hole drill.
  Stage 3 (datasheet pinout + autoroute): fetched the Alps SKRHABE010 circuit-diagram GIF, confirmed pin functions (1=A, 2=Center, 3=C, 4=B, 5=Common, 6=D — three pins were wrong in Rev 1). Schematic rebuilt from scratch using the kleeb symbol with the proper pin names. PCB autorouted headlessly via the `ghcr.io/freerouting/freerouting` Docker image (DSN exported via `pcbnew.ExportSpecctraDSN`, SES imported via `pcbnew.ImportSpecctraSES`): 23 segments + 1 via, 534 mm total length, **8 bends all at 45°, zero 90° corners**, 0 clearance violations, 0 unconnected, 0 schematic-parity issues per `kicad-cli pcb drc`.
- **Files / interpretation:**
  - `hardware-design/joystick-pcb/joystick-pcb.kicad_sch` — rebuilt with kleeb-cloned `SW_SKRHABE010` lib_symbol (A/Center/C/B/Common/D pin names), Conn_01x06_Pin connector, label-stub style routing.
  - `hardware-design/joystick-pcb/joystick-pcb.kicad_pcb` — Rev 2 footprint with NPTH alignment posts and SMD anchor pads, fully autorouted by Freerouting v2, KiCad 10 format.
  - `hardware-design/joystick-pcb/design-notes.md` — new pinout table, clearance verification table, headless Freerouting workflow as copy-pasteable bash, footprint provenance citing kleeb and Painterman/Cardinal as cross-references.

Three high-quality PCB renders (top, bottom, iso) generated with `kicad-cli pcb render --quality high`. New blog post `joystick-pcb-rev2-autoroute.md` covering the redesign and the headless autoroute pipeline. `design-evolution.md` got a new "Rev 2 — Joystick Breakout PCB v2.0 + Headless Autoroute" section plus five new version-history rows.

## Prompt #253 — 2026-04-26

**Prompt sequence:** Hand-routed joystick breakout PCB design session in KiCad 10 (~20 turns). Started with missing symbol libraries ("I have no symbols available in KiCad how do I get a symbol lib"), installed `kicad-library`, pulled the K1-1506SN-01 5-way switch from JLCPCB via `easyeda2kicad` (LCSC C145910), added a 6-pin connector header, wired the schematic (COM to ground, 5 direction signals to GPIOs via internal pull-ups), annotated components, assigned footprints, drew a 19.6x19.6mm edge cut, centered the joystick, added silkscreen labels (Com/L/D/UP/R/C), fixed ERC errors, exported gerbers and JLCPCB-compatible BOM.

- **Commit:** `cab962e` — Hand-routed joystick PCB (K1-1506SN-01) + blog/docs/prompts update
- **Summary:** First PCB designed entirely from scratch (no autorouter). KiCad workspace screenshot cropped into 4 labeled JPEGs (PCB layout, schematic, 3D viewer, full workspace). New blog post `joystick-hand-routed-pcb.md`. Design evolution updated with new section and version history row. Front page updated with joystick PCB 3D preview image and current progress. JLCPCB BOM reformatted in `production/bom.csv`.
- **Layman summary:** Designed a tiny circuit board (about the size of a postage stamp) for a joystick controller. Started from nothing — installed the parts catalog, downloaded the joystick component from an online supplier, drew the wiring diagram, laid out where every wire goes on the board, added labels so you know which wire is which direction, and exported the manufacturing files to send to a factory in China that will make the real board.

## Prompt #254 — 2026-04-26
- **Prompt sequence:** Extended iterative SCAD session (~15 turns) covering top cover face plate curvature tuning, base plate pillar extension height adjustability, and solar panel integration. Key turns:
  - Top cover: multiple attempts at a `face_plate_outer_edge_curve_radius_mm` parameter to independently control the face-to-wall rollover without bulging the sides or affecting the display window. Final approach uses `scale([1,1,zr/case_r])` on the top spheres to create an ellipsoid — flat face in Z, unchanged walls in XY.
  - Base plate (thinner): `peg_height_above_pillar_mm` Customizer slider added (0–10mm, 0.1mm steps). `pillar_extension_z_above_plate_mm` parameter added to `base-plate-v1-2mm-thinner.scad` with negative range support (-10 to +10mm). Original 5x5 screw pillars kept at fixed height; only extension wings respond to the Z adjustment.
  - Solar panel: new `base-plate-with-solar-cutout.scad` forked from the thinner variant. 62x36mm pit (AK 62X36 panel dimensions), 2mm deep, centered on bottom face. Two 3mm wire pass-through holes at adjustable coordinates. Breakaway support ribs added (0.4mm walls, 5mm spacing, 0.2mm Z gap) for printing the pit ceiling without slicer supports.
  - Cleanup: joystick-pcb/ (autorouter version) deleted in favor of joystick-pcb-by-hand/. Solar params removed from thinner file after fork.

## Prompt #255 — 2026-04-26

- **Prompt sequence:** Multi-turn session adding Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W (RP2350) as a third target board alongside Pico W and ESP32-S3. Major iterative effort covering board support, GUI adaptation, build system porting, and resolving RP2350 platform incompatibilities. Key turns:
  - Board support: added `BOARD_PICO2_W` to `board_config.h` (same pins, 4MB flash), `firmware/CMakeLists.txt`, DevTool board selector dropdown, `setup.py` CLI (`--board pico2`).
  - DevTool GUI: full sweep of all user-visible strings — FlashUtility, ConnectionUtility, PinViewer, DocumentationTab, ProgramsTab — all now dynamically show "Pico 2 W (RP2350)" or "Pico W (RP2040)" based on dropdown selection. BOOTSEL drive label shows "RP2350" vs "RPI-RP2". Documentation tab refreshes on board change.
  - Dockerfile: `PICO_BOARD` env var made configurable (was hardcoded `pico_w`).
  - BOOTSEL detection: `find_rpi_rp2_mount()` updated in both `devtool.py` and `setup.py` to search for both `RPI-RP2` (Pico W) and `RP2350` (Pico 2 W) drive labels.
  - CMake cache poisoning: stale `PICO_PLATFORM=rp2040` in build dirs caused failures when switching to `pico2_w`. Added cache detection logic that checks both `PICO_BOARD` and `PICO_PLATFORM` and auto-wipes `build/` on mismatch.
  - RTC compat: RP2350 has no hardware RTC — `hardware/rtc.h` and `pico/util/datetime.h` (which defines `datetime_t`) don't exist. Created `rtc_compat.h` that defines `datetime_t` and software `rtc_init()`/`rtc_set_datetime()`/`rtc_get_datetime()` using `time_us_64()` on RP2350, passes through to real hardware on RP2040. Updated all 18 program `main.c` files and CMakeLists.txt files (conditional `hardware_rtc` linking).
  - Docs: new `website/docs/docs/reference/pico-2-w.md` with specs comparison, critical gotchas, and migration guide. Added to mkdocs nav.

## Prompt #257 — 2026-04-27

- **Prompt sequence:** Multi-turn SCAD session forking two design files for the next print pass, plus a battery-procurement research thread. Key turns:
  - Fork the solar-cutout base plate using the `with supports` preset values as baked defaults — name it `base-plate-solar-thin-af-27-04`. (Preset deltas: `solar_pit_*`, `solar_hole_*`, `aaa_bay_x_start/length`, `battery_rail_z_lift`, `cradle_pocket_floor_thickness`, `outer_case_bottom_edge_fillet_radius`, `pico_retention_block_height`, `pillar_extension_y/z`, `usb_sidewall_block_width_y`, `solar_support_enabled false` — 17 knobs in total.)
  - User then hand-edited the new `.json` to a "thick floo reduce negative space" preset (total height 11.5 → 8 mm, floor 2.5 → 2.6 mm, pico retention 7 → 3 mm) and rendered with that preset.
  - Battery procurement: confirmed PKCELL ICR10440 (3.7 V, 350 mAh, 4-pack, ~€16 on Amazon DE) as the correct cell for the TP4056 + solar charging path — verified against the listing's `3.7 V Lithium Ion / ICR10440` spec, distinguished from regulated 1.5 V AAA-form-factor cells (the Ansmanns) which would be wrong for a TP4056.
  - Fork the AAA cradle insert using the `working insert 4-26-26` preset values — name it `aaa-cradle-with-batt-clips`. Preset values matched parent SCAD constants exactly (no value bake), so the fork only adds the new feature: 4 vertical drop-in slots sized for the **smallest Swpeet 1.5V AAA battery contact plate** (7×7 mm stamped sheet metal), one at each X-end of each AAA bay. Slot dimensions: 7.4 × 7.4 × 0.9 mm (size + 0.2 slop per edge, plate ~0.5 mm thick + tolerance), centered on cell axis, opening upward to plug top so plates drop in post-print and wires exit through the top.
  - Render both new files to 3MF; commit and push the design evolution; update prompts.
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~400 across the sequence
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~25,000
- **Commit:** `faf44b7` — Thin-af base plate fork + cradle with batt-clip slots + 10440 battery research
- **Summary:** Two new SCAD forks for the 2026-04-27 design pass: a thinner solar-cutout base plate (`base-plate-solar-thin-af-27-04`) carrying the with-supports preset as defaults, and an AAA cradle with battery-clip slots (`aaa-cradle-with-batt-clips`) sized for the cheapest Swpeet 7×7 mm unipolar contact plates. The cradle slots are oriented in YZ, opening to the plug top — 0.9 mm friction-fit thickness, plates drop in from above, wires exit upward. Battery-of-record settled: PKCELL ICR10440 raw 3.7 V Li-Ion AAA, wired in **parallel** (not series — 2S = 7.4 V exceeds the Pico W's 5.5 V VSYS max). Adhesive research note added (`solar-panel-bonding-adhesives.md`) covering Sikaflex / VHB / DOWSIL options for bonding the AK 62×36 panel to a PETG base plate outdoors.
- **Layman summary:** Cloned two 3D-print files to start the next iteration. The base plate gets a name based on its goal — make it really thin. The battery cradle gets a new feature — four little slots at the ends of each battery cylinder, sized to hold the metal contact tabs from a cheap multi-pack of battery springs. Also nailed down which rechargeable AAA-shaped batteries to actually buy (the 3.7 V "raw lithium" kind — not the deceptively similar 1.5 V "smart" kind — because the charger board on the device only knows how to charge the raw kind), and wrote up which glues survive years of sun for sticking the solar panel down.

## Prompt #258 — 2026-04-27

- **Prompt:** "put a small 1mm thick retaining side in front of the battery clip holder so it will hold the battery clip in and only surround the perimeter so that contact points are exposed to the battery" — followed by a render-and-push pass after a user-named preset was added.
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~80
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~3,500
- **Commit:** `583744d` — Add retainer wall to batt-clip slots
- **Summary:** Added a 1 mm retainer wall on the cell side of each of the 4 battery-clip slots in `aaa-cradle-with-batt-clips.scad`. Implementation uses SUBTRACTIVE geometry (no floating add-ons): each slot is pulled back from its bay end by `batt_clip_retainer_thickness_x_mm`, leaving body material as the wall, and a smaller central window (`batt_clip_retainer_window_size_y/z_mm`, default 5 × 5 mm) is cut through the wall to expose the plate's contact face to the cell. The wall catches the 7 × 7 mm Swpeet plate's perimeter with 1 mm of edge engagement on all sides. Cylinder cut shaves ~0.1 mm off the wall on the bay side, so effective wall thickness is ~0.9 mm (close enough to spec). Four new tunable knobs: `batt_clip_retainer_enabled` (true), `_thickness_x_mm` (1.0), `_window_size_y_mm` / `_window_size_z_mm` (5.0). Set enabled=false to revert to the original through-slot. User then added a new customizer preset `battery clips first print 04-27` capturing these values for the next print run, and rendered it.
- **Layman summary:** Each battery contact tab now has a tiny picture-frame in front of it — a 1 mm wall with a 5 mm hole cut in the middle. The frame catches the edge of the metal contact tab so it can't fall sideways into the battery hole, but the hole in the frame's middle lets the contact still touch the battery's terminal. Like a window screen: the screen catches the bug, the air gets through.

- **Summary:** Analyzed the JLCPCB placement verification email for the joystick PCB order. The factory flagged SW1 (K1-1506SN-01) because the near-symmetric package makes automated rotation detection unreliable. "Polarity" in this context means component orientation, not electrical polarity — the switch is passive. Confirmed the placement image shows the correct rotation (pin A/up arrow away from header). Documented the exchange, the full PCB design journey (autorouted Rev 1 failure through hand-routed Rev 2 success), current build status, and lesson learned (add pin 1 silkscreen dot). New blog post with build status table and next steps.

- **Input Tokens (est):** ~40

- **Commit:** `a4abf3f` — DesignTool: embedded label feature + export history tracking
- **Summary:** Added a label-embedding option to the DesignTool's Export tab. Recessed or raised text on any vertical face (front/back/left/right), configurable font size, depth, and position. Uses a two-pass STL workflow: plain export first, then a wrapper SCAD that `import()`s the STL and applies `difference()` (recessed) or `union()` (raised) with a `linear_extrude`d `text()` block. Label details recorded in description.md and history.json for each export.
- **Layman summary:** Added a feature to stamp a filename or product number onto the side of your 3D-printed part — like a tiny engraved label that won't interfere with the flat bottom sitting on the print bed.

## Prompt #261 — 2026-04-27
- **Prompt:** "take the models in the Dilder Pico Prototype with joystick cutout aaa battery holder and clip cutouts Working Model Rev 1 and create a proper parametric FreeCAD design based on the SCAD and parameters setup"
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~60
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~25,000
- **Commit:** `5d25c9a` — FreeCAD PartDesign parametric model — full 3-part enclosure
- **Summary:** Translated all three Rev 2 enclosure parts (base plate, AAA cradle, top cover) from OpenSCAD to FreeCAD. First attempt used `Part::Feature` (frozen CSG shapes) — looked correct but had no editable feature tree. Rebuilt from scratch using real PartDesign API: `Sketcher::SketchObject` with constraints, `PartDesign::Pad`, `PartDesign::Pocket`, `PartDesign::Fillet`, `AdditiveBox`, `AdditiveCylinder`, `SubtractiveCylinder`. 81 features across 3 Bodies, 90-parameter spreadsheet with expression links. Fixed face-coordinate-system issues by replacing sketch-on-face pockets with `SubtractiveBox`/`SubtractiveCylinder` using explicit placement coordinates. Added USB-C stadium-shaped cutout (rounded bottom corners, open top) using 3 subtractive features. Comprehensive FreeCAD guide written with step-by-step tutorial panels showing 2D sketch diagrams alongside 3D results.
- **Layman summary:** Converted the entire Tamagotchi case design from a text-based CAD tool (OpenSCAD) into a visual CAD tool (FreeCAD) where you can click on any part of the model and change its dimensions by typing new numbers. Like going from editing code to using a graphical editor.

## Prompt #262 — 2026-04-28
- **Prompt sequence:** Multi-turn FreeCAD rebuild of the TopCover body. Started with a viewing question ("how do I see the final part?"), escalated to "the topcover doesn't have the cutouts like the SCAD does," then "rebuild it from scratch with proper sketches and constraints — option C," then "I want a full master sketch for this," followed by "the cavity has a plane covering the inside and the FPC divet is missing," and finally "I want ZX sketches to alter component depths so I can make the top cover as thin as possible."
- **Input Tokens (est):** ~400 across the sequence
- **Output Tokens (est):** ~40,000
- **Commit:** `8868f13` — Parametric TopCover rebuild with master sketch + Z-section + prompt #262
- **Summary:** Full parametric rebuild of the TopCover Body in `Dilder_Rev2_PartDesign.FCStd`. Replaced the placement-based `SubtractiveBox` / `SubtractiveCylinder` primitives from prompt #261 with a sketch-driven master-sketch architecture. New `topcover_master_sketch.FCMacro` (~700 lines) builds: a 30-alias `TC_Params` spreadsheet (the dimensional source of truth); `Sk_Master_Plan` — a single XY-plane construction-only sketch holding every plan-view outline (outer shell, cavity, 4 pillars, screen inlay, display window, FPC ribbon divet, joystick PCB pocket, joystick through-hole, 4 M3 bores) fully constrained to spreadsheet aliases so the entire plan is visible in one diagram; per-feature sketches (`Sk_Shell`, `Sk_Cavity`, `Sk_Pillar_1..4`, `Sk_Inlay`, `Sk_Window`, `Sk_Joystick`, `Sk_M3_1..4`, `Sk_JoyPCB`, `Sk_FPC`) each on its own datum offset, with full geometric (Coincident, Horizontal, Vertical) + dimensional (DistanceX, DistanceY, Diameter) constraints all expression-bound to the same aliases; PartDesign Pads/Pockets driven by those sketches plus `Fillet_Corners` (vertical edges) and `Fillet_Bullnose` (top edges); display window and joystick hole get tapered Pockets (23.05° and 17.70° outward draft) matching SCAD's `hull()`-based frustum cuts. Two debug iterations: (1) the master sketch's overlapping rectangles caused `makeElementFace: invalid face` errors until every line in the master was flagged construction-only; (2) every `Pocket.Reversed` flag was inverted from convention — verified by an empirical test that proved `Reversed=False` cuts in -Z (downward) from the sketch plane (not +Z as initially assumed), causing the cavity to never carve out and the FPC divet to extrude into space. Fixed all 7 cuts (cavity now Reversed=True for upward, inlay/JoyPCB/FPC now False for downward, window/joystick/M3-bore now True for upward) — volume dropped 57460 → 20288 mm³ and face count grew 40 → 48, confirming the cuts now actually remove material. Final addition: `Sk_Section_Y23`, an XZ-plane side-profile section through Y=23 (display + joystick centerline) showing the full Z-layout as construction lines — outer envelope rectangle, 7 horizontal Z-level construction lines (`Z_ext_bot`, `Z_mating`, `Z_fpc_floor`, `Z_inlay_floor`, `Z_face_bot`, `Z_face_top`, `Z_bullnose_top`), and 6 vertical X-marker lines (`X_wall_mx`, `X_wall_px`, `X_inlay_x0/x1`, `X_joy_cx`, `X_fpc_x0`) — every dimension expression-bound so the section visualizes whatever the spreadsheet currently dictates. Documented the thinning levers: total height = `face_bot + fp_z + bull_r` = 11.7 mm; aggressive thin preset (`face_bot=5.0`, `fp_z=0.5`, `bull_r=1.5`) drops it to 7.0 mm. BasePlate and AAACradle bodies untouched. Pre-rebuild `.bak` snapshot kept for rollback.
- **Layman summary:** Took the case's top cover and rebuilt it inside FreeCAD so every shape is now a real editable sketch instead of a frozen box. There's one "master diagram" sketch that shows the whole top-down view in one place, and a side-view sketch that shows every height layer (where the screen sits, where the face plate is, how thick the rolled top edge is). Both sketches are wired to a parameter spreadsheet — change a number there, hit recompute, and the cover updates. To make the cover thinner, edit three numbers: how much room the screen needs, how thick the top plate is, and how rounded the top edge is. Also fixed two bugs along the way: the cavity wasn't actually hollowing out (had a "ceiling plane" floating inside) and the cable slot wasn't getting cut — both because every Pocket was set to cut in the wrong direction.

- **Commit:** `9d96395` — Rev 2 Mk2 enclosure: final SCAD parts, FreeCAD macro fix, renders, README update
- **Summary:** Fixed the solar panel wire holes in `dilder_rev2_mk2.FCMacro` — the two `SubtractiveCylinder` features were at step 7 in the feature tree, but steps 9-12 added pillars, wings, rail supports, and blocks on top. Since PartDesign evaluates sequentially, the holes only cut material that existed at step 7. Moved them to step 13 (last operation) so they cut through everything. Also added final baked SCAD files for all 3 parts, FreeCAD Mk2 design files (FCStd + 3MF exports), rendered all parts via OpenSCAD CLI (base plate top/bottom, AAA cradle, top cover, assembled), added render gallery to README front page, updated Phase 6 progress, and added `*.FCBak` to `.gitignore`.
- **Layman summary:** The wire holes for the solar panel weren't going all the way through the base plate because they were being drilled before walls and supports were added on top — like drilling a hole in a table before gluing a shelf over it. Moved the drilling step to the very end so it punches through everything. Also took nice pictures of all three parts and put them on the project's front page.

- **Commit:** `eb6e5c2` — Pico 2 W in FreeCAD assembly: STEP import, procedural headers, named-face anchoring
- **Summary:** Added the Pico 2 W board to the FreeCAD assembly with procedural pin headers and named-face anchoring. Raspberry Pi only publishes an official STEP for the (non-W) Pico 2, but it's mechanically identical to the Pico 2 W — only the wireless module differs. Downloaded `Pico-R3-step.zip` (a redirect chain off `datasheets.raspberrypi.com`) and committed `RaspberryPi-Pico-2.step` to `hardware-design/reference-boards/raspberry-pi-pico-2/`. Wrote `add_pico_with_headers()` in `dilder_rev2_mk2.FCMacro`. Five-stage pipeline: (1) `Part.Shape().read()` the STEP, then bbox-driven re-orientation — shortest axis becomes +Z, then a 90° Z rotation if the long axis ended up on Y — making the import robust to any source-CAD convention. (2) Optional 180° Z reverse (`PICO_USB_PLUS_X = False`) so the USB-C end sits on the −X side of the bbox. (3) Procedural 2×20 pin headers built **below** the board: two 50.8 mm shroud strips (one per long edge, 2.54 mm wide × 2.54 mm tall) plus 40 brass pins (0.64 mm square × 8.6 mm tall) on a 2.54 mm pitch with first pin 1.61 mm from one short edge and 1.0 mm row inset from each long edge — matching the standard Pico footprint. (4) A single 180° rotation about world X applied to **both** shapes — flips the board upside-down so components face −Z, headers swing from below to above with pins now pointing +Z. (5) Anchor to named cradle faces — `resolve_face_global((body, idx))` returns the global XYZ of `body.Tip.Shape.Faces[idx-1].CenterOfMass` after applying the body's `Placement`. `PICO_ANCHOR_FACE = ("AAACradle", 44)` gives the inner −X wall of the PicoNest cavity (global X = 11.20) — used to translate `bbox.XMin` to that X. `PICO_Z_ANCHOR_FACE = ("AAACradle", 6)` gives the plug-top mating plane (global Z = 6.00) — and the Z anchor expression is `target_z - (bb.ZMax - PCB_THICKNESS)` so the **component-side face** (one board thickness below the post-flip ZMax) lands flush, not the lowest point. Result: PCB component-side face at Z = 6.00 (flush with cradle), components hang to Z = 3.27 (into the base plate's cradle pocket), pin tips at Z = 18.14 (well into the cradle's PicoNest cavity). One critical ordering fix: the Pico import has to run **after** the cradle's `Placement` is applied in `main()`, otherwise the face center-of-mass resolves to local cradle coords (X = 85.10) instead of global (X = 11.20). Four new FreeCAD-rendered assembly images (iso with translucent cover, no-cover, cradle-hidden, front elevation) committed under `hardware-design/renders/` and copied into `website/docs/assets/images/enclosure/`. README front page got a "Pico 2 W in the Assembly" section. New blog post `website/docs/blog/posts/freecad-pico-import-and-assembly.md` walks through the technique. New doc page `website/docs/docs/hardware/freecad-mk2-macro.md` is a section-by-section macro reference covering helpers, the Parameters spreadsheet, all three body builds, the assembly-placement order, and the five-stage Pico import pipeline. `mkdocs.yml` nav updated. Design evolution table got a 2026-04-29 row. Website prompts index #264 synced.
- **Layman summary:** Added a real-looking Raspberry Pi Pico W board (with the little black pin-strips) to the 3D model so you can finally *see* where the brain of the device sits inside the case. Found that the Pi Foundation only ships the file for the non-wireless Pico (the wireless one is the same shape anyway), downloaded it, and wrote a script that automatically figures out which way the file is oriented and rotates it to match. Built the pin headers by code instead of downloading them. Then flipped the whole board upside-down so the chips face the floor and the pins poke up — like mounting a Pico under a shelf. Instead of typing in coordinates ("put the board at X=11.2"), the script asks the case "where's the inside of your wall?" and uses *that* as the anchor — so if you make the case bigger, the board moves with it automatically. Also re-rendered the case from inside FreeCAD with the Pico in place (you can see through the lid in one image, lid removed in another), updated the front page, wrote a blog post, and wrote a separate "how the macro works" reference page.

- **Commit:** `a906cf1` — Add AAA cells, TP4056 charger, and Waveshare e-paper to FreeCAD assembly
- **Summary:** Two related fixes plus a peripherals expansion. (1) `Cut_Window` placement literals were stale — `win_w=48, win_h=22` while the spreadsheet `win_xl/win_yd` had moved to 50/25, so the centered placement formula `(65 - win_w)/2 + win_shift` computed a gap based on the OLD width and the cut grew off one corner instead of equally on both ends. Updated literals to 50/25 to match. (2) Wired `win_y0` directly to `joy_cy = enc_y/2` instead of going through `disp_y0`, making the window-vs-joystick Y alignment explicit so future joystick Y changes propagate to the window automatically. (3) Added `add_peripherals(doc)` to the macro — built three more components procedurally since most third-party STEP models for these are behind login/paywalls (CraftedTech, GrabCAD) and Waveshare doesn't publish CAD for the Pico-ePaper-2.13. Two AAA Li-Ion cells (10.5 mm × 39.5 mm cylinders + 5.5 mm brass positive-terminal caps) anchored to global Y=7.85/38.15, Z=12.05, X centered in each cradle bay's effective length range. TP4056 USB-C charge module (28 × 17 × 1.6 mm navy blue PCB + IC/capacitor block + silver USB-C connector protruding +X toward the base plate cutout) seated in the cradle's TP4056_Indent recess so the board top face is flush at global Z=6.0. Waveshare 2.13" e-paper display module (65 × 30 × 3 mm off-white carrier with a 50 × 22 mm "paper white" active panel rectangle on the +Z face, win-shifted +2.8 toward +X to match the window cut) sized to fill the top cover's screen inlay; module back at Z=18.0, panel surface at Z=21.0 visible through the display window. Re-rendered all four assembly views with peripherals visible and TopCover transparency dialed back from 60 → 40% so the cover actually shows up against the white background. README, FreeCAD macro reference doc, and design-evolution table updated.
- **Layman summary:** Fixed a small bug where the screen window in the top lid had grown off to one side instead of staying centered (it was using stale numbers from before the window got resized). Then locked the window's vertical centerline to the joystick's centerline so future tweaks stay in sync. Then added three more chunks of "fake" hardware to the 3D model so you can see the whole device assembled: two AAA batteries sitting in their bays, the little USB-C charger board tucked into its dimple, and the e-ink screen module fitting into its window pocket. Couldn't find free 3D models for the charger and screen so I just built them by hand using the published dimensions — same trick used for the pin headers. The new render shows everything inside through the translucent blue lid: green Pico board upside-down, black header pins, gold-toned battery cradle with two grey cells, white screen poking up through the window, silver USB-C nub on the side.
